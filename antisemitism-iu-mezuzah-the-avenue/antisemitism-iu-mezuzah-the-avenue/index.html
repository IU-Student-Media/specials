Raised by Russian parents who left the Soviet Union due to antisemitism, Maya and her sister were raised to be unflinchingly proud of their Jewish identities. </p><p>Growing up, her family was heavily involved in Jewish culture. She attended Hebrew school, went to a Russian Jewish heritage synagogue and took a trip to Israel as her bat mitzvah gift. But aside from the formal schooling and traditions, the spiritual side of Judaism and the teachings of the Torah weren’t a major part of her childhood. </p><p>That changed in high school when she participated in a Jewish Russian women’s research internship that sparked an interest to learn more about her faith. </p><p>Finding a strong Jewish community became a priority in her college search. Soon, Maya had her heart set on attending IU. She’d heard good things about the Kelley School of Business and felt an immediate connection with Hillel when she visited campus. She could tell the big building had frequent student traffic, and its presence alone was reassuring of a strong Jewish community. “This is going to be home for me,” she thought.</p><p>Hillel, IU’s official Jewish culture center, <a href="https://iuhillel.org/faq-students" target="_blank">estimates</a> 12% of IU students are Jewish. Hillel, along with Chabad — a Jewish outreach organization with chapters across the country that Maya has attended since childhood — offer community, celebration and support to Jewish students.</p><p>Maya didn’t expect the frequent, egregious antisemitism at IU when she came to campus her freshman year. But the incident with the mezuzah was closer than any other she’d experienced. </p><p>It happened at The Avenue, an apartment complex where Maya formerly lived. She knew Larena Guberman and Mya Levy, the residents whose mezuzah was vandalized. </p><p>Now she knows antisemitism is not uncommon here. Although every incident is still upsetting, she said, it’s never truly surprising. </p></div><section class="interview"><div class="container"><div class="video"><div id="player1" class="player" data-youtube-video-id="wWWiaiJygfU"></div></div><figcaption class="animated" data-anim-class="animate-in">Maya Goldenberg, Sonia Nussbaum, and Elisha Breton speak on what it means to be Jewish at IU and how they all actively work to combat antisemitism on campus.</figcaption></div></section><div class="story">​<div class="ad"><p class="ad-caption">Advertisement</p><div class="ad-code"><div id="div-gpt-ad-1512489859064-2" align="center"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function () {

Even behind a screen, Maya instantly felt anxious.</p><p>The next day, she happened to walk past the wall where the swastika had been painted.

The swastika had quickly been covered, painted over the same evening by Rabbi Levi Cunin and students at Chabad, the first to notice the symbol. Leaders from Chabad also held a service in front of the building, where they lit a menorah and sang in honor of Hanukkah. </p><p>Despite the square of bright white paint that stood out against the grayish wall, Maya still felt scared.

He said he vandalized it because of ignorance and poor judgment. </p><p>While walking in The Avenue with a few other people on Sept. 29, he said he saw what he assumed to be a note encased in a plastic tube. Curious, he tore it down to take a look. </p><p>After opening the mezuzah’s case and realizing the contents were religious, he said he left the mezuzah at the doorstep in an effort to return it.</p><p>The mezuzah was found partially burned. In an interview with the Indiana Daily Student, Patzelt did not admit to burning it, instead saying he “tampered” with the mezuzah to open it. </p><p>He said he didn’t realize at the time the offensive message leaving it at the doorstep could send. He apologized to the Jewish community in the IDS interview.</p><p>Patzelt was charged with two counts of criminal mischief in October. His pretrial hearing was scheduled for Jan. 6, 2023, but was canceled due to an “agreement from parties,” court records show. </p><p>Almost a month later, Patzelt said he spoke with residents Larena Guberman and Mya Levy, who he claimed were understanding of the situation. Guberman and Levy did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the IDS by the time of publication.</p><p>When asked to comment on Patzelt’s apology, Maya said she doesn’t buy it. </p><p>“It literally has Hebrew on it,” she said. “How do you look at that and just think it’s decoration?” </p><p>The people behind the GreekRank comments and the swastika on Sixth and Lincoln remain unknown. It’s unclear whether any of these incidents were connected, but they’re all indicative of a larger anti-Jewish sentiment, Maya said. And for her, each one feels the same: like a slap in the face. </p><p>“Every time I feel maybe safe or comfortable or I’m just going about my day not worrying about being Jewish, it’s a reminder, like, ‘You’ve got to be careful,’” she said.</p>​<div class="ad"><p class="ad-caption">Advertisement</p><div class="ad-code"><div id="div-gpt-ad-1512489859064-2" align="center"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function () {

People may know about Judaism generally, she said, but they rarely know specifics, nor do they understand how much antisemitism affects others. </p><p>It can be difficult to make long-lasting change. Each new cohort of IU freshmen brings the risk of more antisemitism. </p><p>In her 32 years at IU, 2022 has been the worst Silberberg has seen in terms of antisemitism. She attributes the uptick in incidents in part to the political climate and the presidency of Donald Trump, who has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/trump-history-antisemitic-tropes/" target="_blank">long perpetuated anti-Jewish tropes</a>. Although many people have held these viewpoints, she said, they are now more likely to speak out. </p><p>When students inform her of an incident, she helps them with things like contacting police, working with residence halls or just listening. </p><p>Often, she senses fear, hurt, anger and confusion. Silberberg tries to encourage them; she believes there are more good people who want to be Jewish allies than those who don’t. But she has felt scared and discouraged before, too. She tries to focus on the progress that’s been made, like seeing politicians who have pushed antisemitic rhetoric be defeated and mobilizing the community to support those affected by antisemitism. </p><div class="pullquote"><div class="container"><div class="profile-card"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/84c60b8c-cc05-4f51-b703-d48d31a2f2cf.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt=""></div></div><p>It’s hard to be Jewish off by yourself in a corner,” she said. “Because community is so much a part of who we are as Jews.” </p></div><p>But she knows antisemitism persists, even when people speak up about it. She said it’s not enough to simply remember things like the Holocaust. What’s most important, especially now, is action. </p><p>“We have to use that memory of what happened to inspire us to continue to fight against it,” she said. </p><p>She just hopes people will learn from the past. </p><div class="section-break" data-in-offset=""></div><p class="dropcap">Antisemitism follows Maya everywhere.</p><p>Even back to her hometown in Illinois, where she felt relatively safe growing up in what she called a “Jewish bubble.” She's since realized the rest of the world isn't always so safe.</p><p>This past May, she experienced one of the most jarring instances of antisemitism at a library in Chicago where she went to do homework one day. </p><p>In the study room next to her, two boys were talking, and she heard one of them mention Hitler. Taken aback, Maya stepped close enough to the room to peek at the boys. One of the teens opened the door of the study room. </p><p>“Kill the Jews!” he yelled. “Hitler! Hitler! Hitler!”</p><p>Maya stood there in shock. “What just happened?” she thought. </p><p>She doesn’t know for sure that the words were directed toward her, but she thinks they were. She’d worn her Star of David necklace that day, and she also has a Jewish sticker on her laptop. </p><p>While the words hurt, Maya said the worst part of the situation was what happened after. Sobbing, she told a librarian about the incident. She hoped the librarian would talk to the teens and potentially educate them, but they just asked them to leave. </p><p>Maya wishes she knew where those kids ended up. She hopes they’ll be educated eventually about why their words were wrong.</p><p>Education is one of the most impactful ways to combat antisemitism, Maya said. Sometimes, she's the first Jewish person someone has met. That realization has made her more aware of how she presents herself. </p><p>“You’re representative of all your people at all times, which is a lot of pressure,” she said. “You want to try to make those interactions positive but also know that, if someone has hate in their heart, there’s nothing I can do to, in the moment, maybe persuade them that we’re normal people.” </p><p>Maya called her mother after the library incident to tell her what happened. She thought of the parallels between what she’d faced and what her mother went through in Russia — like being harassed for being Jewish in the Soviet Union. </p><p>“She came to this country so that her kids wouldn’t have to experience things like that,” Maya said. “I just felt her heart breaking.” </p><p>Maya said she and her family have had conversations about leaving the country should antisemitism become too extreme. They’re not the only ones. Many Jewish people across the country have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/06/1133608843/antisemitic-rhetoric-kanye-jewish-communities-reaction" target="_blank">rethinking how to stay safe</a> in a country where hate against them only seems to increase, in an effort to outrun a beast as old as Judaism itself.</p><p>“We definitely know that if shit hits the fan, we’re not staying,” she said. </p><p>Her parents know their limit. Maya said, if policy changes were introduced within the government that oppressed Jewish people, moving to Israel — a place she’s visited twice before and where some of her family lives — is an option she’s okay with. </p><p>“It definitely feels special there as a Jew,” she said. “This is your ancestral homeland. This is where you belong. This place will always come to save you if your countries kick you out again.” </p><div class="section-break"></div></div><div class="gallery-container gallery-sticky quotes"><div class="gallery" id="gallery"><div class="sticky-inner"><div class="pullquote"><div class="container"><div class="profile-card"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/34b24868-b3d7-4fc7-93ba-7918c4d80fe2.sized-1000x1000.jpg" alt=""></div></div><p>Maya said that a few times, antisemitic incidents have happened during Jewish holidays or observances such as Shabbos, when many Jewish people don't use technology for a certain amount of time. This can sometimes leave them in the dark for a while after incidents occur. "Over holidays, you have to be extra aware, I guess, as a Jew," Maya said.

Shortly after starting freshman year in 2021, she checked out Hillel and Chabad to be with her peers and practice Jewish traditions. </p><p>Kim is Black and Jewish. With only one other Black student and one other Jewish student on her dorm floor at Eigenmann Hall, she felt out of place. What started as an attempt to make friends turned into a torrent of racism and antisemitism. </p><p>She remembers white floormates shouting the n-word through Black students’ doors. Taping pennies to the doors of Jewish floormates. Saying “Heil Hitler.”One person scattered ripped-up pamphlets from Hillel around the bathroom. </p><p>Scared of the situation continuing but also of retaliation, Kim tried to educate her floormates rather than fire back immediately.</p><p>She told Hillel's student life coordinator about the situation, and Rabbi Silberberg led a bystander intervention meeting for the dorm floor alongside coordinators from Eigenmann and Cedric Harris, leader of IU’s Bias Response Team.</p><p>Kim said the people responsible for the majority of the issues didn’t take the meeting seriously. Silberberg said it seemed like the students were mocking the presentation. They laughed and looked at their phones instead of paying attention and learning. Kim said she later found out they were sending texts about Hitler and Nazis in a group chat for the men on the floor. The texts included photos of people from the floor doing Nazi salutes. </p><p>Kim realized the education wasn’t as effective as she’d hoped. Since she had screenshots as proof, she reported the situation to the Bias Response Team. Kim said if IU determined a student had sent the messages, “liked” the messages or were in the photos, they were kicked off their floor and moved to different residence halls. She said the Bias Response Team interviewed each of the students in the group chat to sort out who did what.</p><p>An IU representative declined to comment on this situation, citing FERPA.</p><p>Around February of this year, Kim met with the Bias Response Team, who told her some of the students had been placed on academic probation. </p><p>Some of her friends at the time even got angry at her for reporting. “You were wrong to report,” Kim remembers them saying. “They didn’t mean it.” “If you were there after the meeting, you would’ve seen that they were sorry.” </p><p>This resulted in even more text exchanges, including a physical threat. She didn’t report further issues out of fear for her safety. </p><p>Kim said after they were given notice to leave the floor, the floormates who’d harassed her created petitions to convince IU to let them move back to Eigenmann if everyone else agreed. Kim said IU told her floormates not to engage with her, but some of them — including people she thought were her friends — asked her to sign the petitions. Kim’s emotions were running high and she felt pressured to sign the petition, so she did. Looking back, she said, putting her name down is one of her biggest regrets. </p><p>The IDS could not confirm whether the petitions had any effect on the situation. Kim said she later heard through friends that some of the people eventually ended up coming back to the original floor at Eigenmann. </p><p>When the university moved her floormates, Kim was given temporary housing in Ashton Residence Center for the remainder of the fall semester, to allow her space from the incident and from those who'd harassed her. For the spring semester, she was given a new housing assignment in Wright. Kim said she had to start over with her social life. She took comfort in her meetings with Silberberg for coffee and her antisemitism research class, which allowed her to spread awareness. </p><p>But coping with what happened was difficult while also worrying about regular college things like choosing a major and doing homework. Kim eventually decided to leave Bloomington and take classes online at home for her sophomore year.</p><p>Space away from campus has given her time to reflect. She has returned to campus a few times since, and considered each time how she felt about potentially returning. The experience still haunts her. Whenever she sees people who resemble those who harassed her, she has flashbacks. She only feels comfortable in Black and Jewish spaces at IU, spaces that can be hard to find.</p><p>She’s considering returning to campus next fall for her junior year. If she does, she hopes to live with her best friends who respect her identity instead of in a dorm with people she doesn’t know. She also wants to invest more time into Chabad and Hillel, where she knows she’ll be safe.</p>​<div class="ad"><p class="ad-caption">Advertisement</p><div class="ad-code"><div id="div-gpt-ad-1512489859064-2" align="center"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function () {

This year, we have witnessed a number of abhorrent and unacceptable antisemitic incidents that have made many feel unwelcome and even unsafe on our campuses. We remain committed to working together to ensure everyone in our IU family feels that they belong.</div><div class="footer">Excerpt from Whitten's statement</div></div><p>Overall, Maya said she thinks the administration does what it can to support Jewish students. She said she has felt supported by various faculty members and appreciates acts of solidarity like when exam dates are moved for Jewish holidays or when Whitten attended Shabbat dinner at Hillel. Maya and other student leaders attended a reception at Whitten's home last year, where they discussed ways to combat antisemitism and shared their stories, and that’s where Maya met Kim.</p><p>But Maya wants IU to take more tangible action. </p><p>“Actions speak louder than words in any case, especially cases of hate crimes or bias or racism,” she said. “Any statement released is very nice to hear, but where's the follow-through?”</p><p>A good place to start, she said, would be more transparency. She wishes IU released more information about processes of holding students accountable. She also wants more transparency about IU’s attempts to uncover anonymous culprits, she said.</p><p>“I understand why they wouldn’t discuss everything that they’re doing, but I feel like it would help if they did,” she said. </p><p>Maya didn’t report most of the incidents to IU’s Bias Response Team,  where students can go to report and discuss incidents of bias,  because she didn’t have evidence and doubted they could address it. However, she did report the two women discussing anti-Jewish conspiracy theories in the IMU.</p><p>Cedric Harris is IU’s assistant dean for student support and bias education. He leads the Bias Response Team. </p><p>Harris strives to stay victim-focused in his work. But punishing those who commit acts of bias isn’t a cut-and-dry process. While the Bias Response Team has the ability to discuss incidents and try to educate the perpetrators, they often must pass on more extreme incidents to IU’s Office of Student Conduct or the police department. If the person accused is anonymous — like in the GreekRank incident — or otherwise unidentifiable, Harris said the Bias Response Team is limited in its ability to confront or punish them. </p><p>Freedom of speech is also a factor, Harris said. While hate speech can cause mental anguish, it’s difficult to expel or punish students based on only their speech.</p><div class="section-break" data-in-offset=""></div><p class="dropcap">On the cold, rainy evening of Dec. 9, Maya and more than 500 other students and leaders gathered in Dunn Meadow for Mega Shabbat, the <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2022/12/record-breaking-500-attendees-at-local-shabbat-gathering" target="_blank">largest celebration of Shabbat in IU history</a>. </p><div class="audio"><audio class="audio-container" controls><source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/4c1973aa-86ed-4687-9941-e1b6e71e3bbe.original.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></div></div><div class="gallery-container gallery-sticky shabbat"><div class="gallery" id="gallery"><div class="sticky-inner"><div class="image-featured"><figure class="glass-card animated" data-anim-class="animate-in"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/21145503-f0e2-48ca-8f9e-0dc11511d5ab.sized-1000x1000.jpg"><figcaption class="animated" data-anim-class="animate-in" data-in-offset="-75"><span class="credit">Christina Avery <svg viewBox="0 0 163.17 68.85"><path d="M0,67.77V1.08H19.89V67.77Z"/><path d="M32.85,67.77V1.08H58.32c19.44,0,38.34,6.21,38.34,33.3,0,26.64-20.07,33.39-39.6,33.39ZM52.74,50.4h5.85c12.06,0,17.91-4.41,17.91-16s-5.67-15.3-18.81-15.3H52.74Z"/><path d="M98.82,59l9.54-13.59c6.66,4.59,15.93,7,23.31,7,9.45,0,11.7-2.16,11.7-4.86s-2.7-3.78-12.51-4.59c-14.31-1.17-28.26-4.86-28.26-21.15C102.6,5.67,115.83,0,131,0c15.84,0,24.48,4.05,29.16,7.83l-9.9,14.31c-3.78-2.52-12.33-4.77-19-4.77s-8.73,1.08-8.73,3.69c0,3.24,2.79,4.05,12.69,4.86,14.94,1.26,28,4.14,28,20.7,0,13.5-11.52,22.23-30.87,22.23C114.66,68.85,105.84,64.53,98.82,59Z"/></svg></span>Signs with celebratory phrases sit on a table at Mega Shabbat.

Every Saturday morning, she prays and studies the Torah with Cunin at Chabad. She has been vice president at Hillel as well as president of Hillel's Business Leader Initiative. She dresses more modestly than she used to, which is a personal choice that helps her feel more connected to God. Her journey with faith is heading toward where she’s always wanted it to be. </p><p>“I think about myself differently. I’m more confident. I think before I speak a little more,” Maya said. “I’m just more intentional with everything I do and the details.”</p><p>Maya knows, even when it feels like others don’t care, she has friends she can lean on who have heard the same remarks, had the same experiences and felt the same sadness and anxiety and anger she has.</p><p>As antisemitism rages across both Bloomington and the country, Maya has much to consider: How to practice her faith safely in Bloomington. How to reckon with the effects of antisemitism.</p><p>Right now, her mezuzah rests safely in the doorway of her apartment. While she initially was unsure whether she’d put up her mezuzah on the doorway of her home next year, the rise in antisemitism has given her a new perspective.</p><p>“No matter what happens — God forbid someone does something to it — that's where it belongs,” she said. “It will serve its purpose by being there. If they tear it down, I'll put two up.”</p><p>Maya is determined not to let antisemitism stop her from living her life on her own terms. She wishes people would take it more seriously. But at the end of the day, she said the hatred only strengthens her relationship with her community, with Judaism and with God. </p><p>Maya thinks about what her community has survived in the past. Just as hate endures, so must faith. </p></div><div class="quote"><div class="container"><div class="headline"><div></div></div><p>We outlived the Babylonians.</p><p>We outlived the Nazis.</p><p>We outlived everyone, and we will continue to,</p><p>and we do that through pride.’</p><p class="credit">&mdash; Maya Goldenberg</p><div class="section-break static" data-in-offset="-150"></div></div></div><div class="story"><div class="resources"><h3>Resources</h3><ul><li style="margin-bottom: 0.3em">To report a hate crime in Bloomington or on IU’s campus, visit the following websites:</li><ul><li style="margin-bottom: 0.3em"><a href="https://reportincident.iu.edu/" target="_blank">IU Bias Incident Reporting</a></li><li><a href="https://bloomington.in.gov/incidents/" target="_blank">Bloomington Police Department Incident Reporting</a></li></ul><li>IUPD is asking residents with any information about the on-campus incident to contact the department at <a href="tel:8128554111">812-855-4111</a>.
