    <p>As is often the case when students die, several people came to CAPS seeking counseling for Yaolin&rsquo;s death. There is no Mandarin-speaking counselor at CAPS, though Stockton is actively seeking one. An after-hours contact number offers counseling in Mandarin.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Having that kind of social support is very, very important,&rdquo; Lin said.</p>

            <p>Lin was part of a team that published a study comparing American and Chinese students&rsquo; perceptions of intimate partner violence. One of the primary findings of the team&rsquo;s research was that Chinese students perceive fewer &#8232;actions as abuse.</p>

            <p>Because fewer Chinese students see abuse as a crime, Lin said, they are also less likely to call the police. The study Lin worked on stated police in mainland China were less likely to intervene in cases of violence between couples.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;... Many police officers regard (intimate partner violence) as private matters beyond police responsibilities and often refuse to accept or process victims&rsquo; complaints,&rdquo; according to the study.</p>
