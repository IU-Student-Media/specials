In the morning, voters waited up to an hour, and the line persisted throughout the day. The line climbed up to around 60 people in the late morning and mid afternoon. Monroe County Clerk Nicole Browne said she was very pleased to see so many people and said the day was running smoothly.<\/p><p>This was IU alumna Alyssa Athens&#x27; second time voting in a general election. The 2020 IU graduate said she decided to vote Tuesday to take advantage of the sunny weather and get ahead of the crowds. While Athens thought it would be convenient to have more options for early voting sites, she was happy with the overall experience.<\/p><p>&quot;I anticipated a little bit longer of a line,&quot; she said. &quot;But it&#x27;s been moving pretty well and everyone&#x27;s been good about social distancing.&quot;<\/p><p>In previous general elections and the 2016 presidential election, the North Showers Building and Election Central were available to the residents of Monroe County for early voting. However, the Monroe County Election Board decided last fall that Election Central would be the sole early voting location for the 2020 general election.<\/p><p>Election Supervisor Karen Wheeler said she believes a single-location system is less confusing to voters. In previous elections, a different location would be open depending on the day.<\/p><p>\u201cI think one actually works better,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cIt was hard to get everybody to understand how that worked.\u201d<\/p><p>Browne said the decision was made based on several factors, including hiring the additional staff needed to run a second polling location and a lack of interest in early voting in past elections. Browne estimated about 10% of Monroe County early voters used the North Showers location in 2016.<\/p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that Monroe County voters recognize we have to have bipartisan teams for every step of the voting process,\u201d Browne said. \u201cFrom the time that you check in, until the time that you turn your ballot over to us, until it can be scanned and tabulated on Election Day.\u201d<\/p><p>Browne had previously estimated a higher turnout for this year\u2019s early voting period due to the COVID-19 pandemic but maintains one polling location will be enough to serve them.<\/p><p>\u201cI am always hopeful for people to take advantage,\u201d Browne said. \u201cI would prefer that people vote early. I have that expectation because that spreads it out for Election Day for people who may not have been able to take advantage earlier.\u201d\u00a0<\/p><p>The budget was heavily considered in the decision to cut an early voting poll. In addition to safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wheeler said it has been an expensive voting season overall.<\/p><p>\u201cWe have spent a lot on our election,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cCan we afford to spend more when we think we can handle it sufficiently? And I think we can.\u201d\u00a0<\/p><p>Browne said one polling location also means ballots will not have to be transported in the evenings as they were in 2016. She said this is crucial to having better ballot security.<\/p><p>The safety precautions and social distancing measures taken during the early voting period will be the same as those taken on Election Day,  Browne said. Voters maintained distance between one another in line, and surfaces and styluses were cleaned after each use.\u00a0<\/p><p>\u201cWe learned a lot from the primary,\u201d Browne said. \u201cWe were able to take what we learned and implement them for the general election.\u201d<\/p><p>Browne said the office has received overwhelming offers for assistance with polls in recent weeks. She is optimistic the election center will be sufficiently staffed throughout the early voting period.<\/p><p>\u201cAt least every day I get about a dozen requests for people to serve,\u201d Browne said. \u201cWe not only have a list, but we have a backup list and I believe that we will be well-staffed for the election.\u201d\u00a0<\/p><p>Those willing to assist at the polls can still apply and are recommended to reach out to the Monroe County Election Center at 812-349-2690 or email a recruiter at <a href=\"mailto:pollrecruiter@monroedems.org\" target=\"\">pollrecruiter@monroedems.org<\/a> for Democratic participants or <a href=\"mailto:pamsamples@gmail.com\" target=\"\">pamsamples@gmail.com<\/a> for Republican participants.\u00a0<\/p>",

          "content": "<p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">In an effort to highlight the importance of political responsibility across the board, the Political Science Club and Students for Equity in Public Affairs brought together four panelists to discuss minority representation Wednesday night. Topics for the panel included police, immigration and abortion issues.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">\u201cWe\u2019re really excited that these issues are able to be discussed in a bipartisan way,\u201d said Rebekah Molasky, senior and president of the Political Science Club.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Molasky and senior Maya Fews of SEPA collaborated to bring the event together. The panelists included School of Public and Environmental Affairs professor Sean Nicholson-Crotty, SEPA member Miguel Palabrica, College Democrats at IU\u2019s Paige Settles and College Republicans at IU\u2019s Nicole Keesling<\/span><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">For a time, Molasky and Fews feared they might not see as much diversity of opinion as they had originally planned.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">The Democrats and Republicans cancelled a three-on-three debate last week over an organizational dispute and had not worked together since. Molasky and Fews said they thought the argument might cause one or both of the organizations to bow out.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">In the end, Keesling and Settles were both able to represent their respective parties at the panel. Both women said they were happy to be working with one another once again.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">\u201cPart of civility is getting past disagreements,\u201d Keesling said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">It opened with discussion of stop-and-frisk, a controversial practice in which police officers stop suspicious individuals to question them and then search them for weapons.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Nicholson-Crotty said law enforcement needs to stop this policy because it was ruled unconstitutional due to disproportionate use on minorities.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">The effects of stop-and-frisk on a minority member\u2019s psyche can be very different than what a white person experiences, Palabrica said. He attributed this to the possibility that minorities feel their race plays a role in the \u2028questioning.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Palabrica also talked about his experience growing up in Chicago and the violence he saw there. He said at night he would either see white people being mugged or cops in his neighborhood targeting and torturing gang members.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">\u201cThe tendency is towards mutual distrust,\u201d Palabrica said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Settles said a solution to the problem could lie in community policing. She cited an apartment complex in Florida where police involvement in the community brought down crime rates by 32 percent.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Although the situation in Chicago might benefit from community policing, its inability to fix the underlying problems of poverty is prohibiting it from lowering crime rates, Keesling said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">The panel also discussed immigration. Keesling took a strong position in support of the wall Donald Trump proposed be built along the Mexican-American border. In addition to the wall itself, there would be additional patrol security, which is where she said the real border security would arise and limit illegal access to the country.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">\u201cWe have responsibility as Americans to help people come here through the right process,\u201d Keesling said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Palabrica disagreed. People would be smuggled in by cars just as they were before, not by climbing a wall, he said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Nicholson-Crotty said he saw the issue as part of the Republican party\u2019s recent inability to recognize how nuanced the Latino vote was. This religious, entrepreneurial group should be have a strong showing for Republicans, but policies like the wall turn them toward the Democrats, he said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Settles said he has noticed Trump is much more conservative than many of Republicans in Congress, and Trump\u2019s conservatism keeps the Latinos away.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">After the group finished discussing the wall, Settles opened the discussion on abortion, which was the last topic of the night, and talked about the Hyde Amendment.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">This amendment restricts federal funding for abortions unless the procedure is used to save the mother\u2019s life or if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Settles said the amendment should be repealed entirely, although other members of the panel disagreed.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">As a pro-life believer, Keesling said the government should stay out of it entirely. She did acknowledge the practice is legal, but thought it should be kept privatized.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">For Nicholson-Crotty, the issue is so closely tied to religious beliefs that the government\u2019s involvement in the process hurts them. He said religious citizens should not have to use their tax dollars to pay for what they believe is murder.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">Palabrica said he did see where the funding could be useful, however. He thought it would help minority women gain access to a service which is much more affordable to whites and the middle class. This would improve equality, which he said the government is responsible for.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-25\">\u201cWe don\u2019t live in a world where reproductive health is equally distributed between blacks, whites and Latinos, and under- and middle-class people,\u201d Palabrica said.<\/span><\/p>",

Her only exception to her pro-choice stance is if the mother\u2019s life is in danger or if the child is significantly deformed.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">Along with that, Finley said she also believes Clinton did not have a strong personality as secretary of state. She said she believes the events of Benghazi, in which four American soldiers were killed in Libya, could have been prevented by the government.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">\u201cIt grieves me that we had four men in Benghazi that lost their lives because of negligence and the lack of leadership in that office to rescue those men,\u201d \u2028Finley said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">Finley said she is also not personally convinced of the prospect of a female president in the U.S. She said she believes women are often motivated by their emotions, and she doesn\u2019t think a woman would be able to fill the position of a strong figurehead who is respected by all cultures.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">However, Republican candidate Donald Trump has had a significant number of controversies in the past regarding his alleged treatment of women. This includes a recently leaked video from 2005 where Trump brags to reporter Billy Bush about his sexual assaults toward women.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">While bothered by Trump\u2019s remarks, Cruikshank said she is more disturbed by how his supporters can overlook what he has said about women.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">\u201cI think the most frightening thing about Donald Trump saying all those things is that people don\u2019t see it as a problem,\u201d Cruikshank said. \u201cHe kind of has a sort of predatory personality, and that plays out particularly toward women.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">If Clinton is elected, Cruikshank said she believes the biggest concern should be understanding why Trump\u2019s supporters either overlooked or supported these remarks and how they can change their mindsets for the better.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">However, while Finley said she agrees some of these remarks have been harsh, she doesn\u2019t think he truly has disrespect for women.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s cruel to women,\u201d Finley said. \u201cI just think he too often speaks before thinking it through.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">Instead, she said she is more concerned about the domestic abuse against women.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">Along with building a wall across the Mexican border, Finley said she also agrees with Trump\u2019s policy of not allowing Syrian refugees to enter the country. She said she believes this will prevent not only terrorist acts, but also violence against women.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">\u201cWomen in this country should be standing up and screaming \u2018We do not want refugees here that treat women the way the women in Europe have been treated by the refugees,\u2019\u201d Finley said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">Under a Trump presidency, Finley said she believes he will respect women and women\u2019s rights, not only on a work level, but also as human beings.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">On the other side, Cruikshank said she believes Clinton\u2019s worldwide influence as a strong female will help her benefit women in the U.S.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"Stories:Body Copy\"><span class=\"[No character style]\" tracking=\"-13\">\u201cShe has been such a pioneer for women\u2019s rights around the world that I imagine that will carry through in everything she does,\u201d Cruikshank said.<\/span><\/p>",
