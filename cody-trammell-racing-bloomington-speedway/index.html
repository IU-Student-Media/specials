                <p>His uncle hands him his gloves while his mentor offers final words of encouragement. Another uncle
                    waits on a
                    four-wheeler behind him, ready to push the car to the starting grid. The pits are hectic on race day
                    &mdash;
                    especially for Cody, who often has a small crowd ready to help at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
                <p>Cody grew up at the Bloomington Speedway. As he continues to push his racing career to new levels, he
                    does so
                    with family by his side.</p>


                <p>It&rsquo;s hard for him to find a moment of peace on the weekends, which are filled with long nights
                    of
                    putting cars together, listening to advice &mdash; sometimes unsolicited &mdash; from caring
                    supporters and
                    feeling the pressure of satisfying sponsors and the need to be on top. It all bubbles to the surface
                    when he
                    pulls his car onto the red clay that the Bloomington Speedway has built its legacy on.</p>

                    wheel. His
                    thoughts are clear. While other drivers talk to themselves as they race, Cody is silent, focusing
                    only on the

                <p>Cody is the third generation of dirt track drivers in his family. He remembers coming to the
                    Bloomington
                    Speedway frequently when he was younger to watch his dad and uncle race.</p>
                <p>He started racing go-karts when he was around 13 and soon upgraded to a mini sprint car handed down
                    from his
                    uncle, Gary Trammell. He competed in mini sprint for about 10 years before he got the opportunity to
                    try his
                    luck at a full-size sprint car.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;That was the ticket,&rdquo; Cody said. &ldquo;That's where I wanted to go to my whole career.
                    That's
                    where I wanted to race.&rdquo;</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The transition from mini sprint cars to bigger, heavier cars was not easy, and Cody struggled his
                    first few
                    times out on track. Cars and teams switch hands frequently in the racing industry, and when the
                    owner of the
                    car Cody drove decided to stop racing, he returned to mini sprints. Later, he found another
                    opportunity to hop
                    in the driver&rsquo;s seat of a full-size sprint car and worked to refine his skills behind the
                    wheel. Kevin
                    Huntley, the namesake for Huntley&rsquo;s Hoosier Winged Sprint Series, helped convert Cody&rsquo;s
                    fumbles to
                    wins.</p>
                <p>A year later, entering a new season in a winged sprint car, he found his footing within a few laps.
                    His first
                    full season in 2022 saw four wins and 14 top five finishes out of 29 races.</p>
                <p>Now, Cody owns his own racing operation with a 410 non-winged sprint car and custom &ldquo;Cody
                    Trammell
                    Racing&rdquo; livery. Nearly all the space on his car&rsquo;s exterior is filled with sponsor logos
                    and
                    slogans, a testament to Cody&rsquo;s loyalty to the brands and people that have helped him along the
                    way.
                    Being born and raised in Bloomington has had its perks, and many of the sponsors backing Cody have
                    been with
                    him since he was 16 years old in a hand-me-down mini sprint car.</p>

                    sponsors
                    are from here.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>He also knows almost everyone on the track. He grew up racing most of the people he sees in the
                    paddock now,
                    including the people who own the Bloomington Speedway. His insurance agent races, too. It&rsquo;s
                    nearly
                    impossible for Cody to walk anywhere in the pits without getting stopped along the way. If
                    they&rsquo;re not
                    striking up a conversation with him, they&rsquo;re offering a wave or friendly middle finger in

                <p>Today, Sept. 5, Cody isn&rsquo;t racing his own car. He&rsquo;s driving one of Barry Miller&rsquo;s,
                    a former
                    off-road driver who recently started racing 305 winged RaceSaver sprint cars. Cody races his own 410
                    non-winged car in the regular season but occasionally races for other people.</p>
                <p>The general components of both types of sprint cars are the same, but the 410s have a larger engine
                    and no
                    wing. The 305s have a smaller engine but make up for the lack of power with a large wing that
                    generates
                    downforce and stabilizes the car. The cars compete in separate races.</p>

                        Speedway. When not on track or preparing for their next race, drivers often watched other heats
                        in the grandstands.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Barry brought two almost identical winged cars to the track &mdash; one for him and one for Cody, who
                    would
                    be racing his car for the third time. Barry knows he&rsquo;s not the fastest driver out there, and
                    it made
                    sense to team up with someone more competitive in hopes of placing higher and earning a bigger
                    payout. Sprint
                    car racing is an individual sport, but many car owners run multiple cars with several drivers
                    because they can
                    earn more money if multiple racers place high enough.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been successful with winged cars in the past,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;Having this
                    extra
                    car, it made sense to have Cody behind the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Sprint races are divided into three sections. Cars start out with a hot lap to warm up, then compete
                    in a
                    qualifying session to set their place in the heat race, where they&rsquo;ll race against a smaller
                    number of
                    cars to determine their place in the feature. The feature is the final race that sets placements and
                    payouts.
                </p>
                <p>Every driver that qualifies to race in a feature and completes one lap earns some amount of money,
                    although
                    the payouts differ depending on where a driver places. Tonight, in the season finale for the
                    Huntley&rsquo;s
                    Hoosier Winged Sprint Series, $10,000 is on the line for the winning driver.</p>

                        feature race at the Bloomington Speedway. The feature race was the final race of the night, and
                        it was what mattered in terms of rankings and prize money.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Cody placed well in the qualifying race, and he finished eighth out of 37 cars in his class. When he
                    got back
                    to the pits, he started making adjustments based on how it felt on the track. His main concern was
                    that the
                    car needed a different gear ratio &mdash; a change that many drivers make between races to pull more
                    power
                    from the motor.</p>
                <p>As the crew works, Cody&rsquo;s sons crowd around them to watch. Carter, 6, and Kayden, 4, share a
                    lot of
                    traits with their dad. They love being a part of the action.</p>
                <p>They&rsquo;re comfortable here. The boys dart between trailers, saying hello to neighboring drivers
                    and
                    showing them the toy cars they brought to play with. Just like Cody was as a child, they are
                    familiar with the
                    drivers and the track.</p>
                <p>Cody&rsquo;s Uncle Gary remembers his nephew parading through the same pits as a child. He knew then
                    he would
                    likely see Cody on the track when he got older, and he&rsquo;s optimistic that at least one of his
                    great
                    nephews will follow in Cody&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>
                <p>When Cody isn&rsquo;t watching the kids, his girlfriend, Payton Rollins, 22, usually is. She walks
                    them to
                    and from the grandstands to watch their dad race and keeps careful track of Cody&rsquo;s times and
                    placements
                    in the qualifying and heat races. Off the track, she helps design Cody&rsquo;s racing suit, car
                    livery and
                    merchandise.</p>

                    the rest
                    of Cody&rsquo;s pit crew as they wander in and out of the trailer looking for supplies. Her brother
                    raced dirt
                    bikes, so she&rsquo;s no stranger to the chaos that comes with a day at the track.</p>
                <p>It&rsquo;s this support system that makes these long days work. Cody is surrounded by family and his
                    closest
                    friends nearly every weekend. No matter the outcome, he knows he can count on them to be there for
                    the next
                    one, although he does his best to make it worthwhile.</p>

                  <figcaption>Trammell and his team work to fix a brake issue Sept. 5, 2025, at the Bloomington Speedway. The brakes were red-hot the last time Trammell drove it, and the heat warped the calipers.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                <p>Less than an hour before he&rsquo;s slated to hit the track for the feature race, Cody&rsquo;s car is
                    in
                    pieces. A previous race caused brake problems that were proving to be an issue on the track. The
                    crew holds
                    flashlights in the dark as they place a makeshift shim between the components that they hoped would
                    last the
                    duration of the race. It had been drizzling intermittently that evening, but now the sun had set,
                    and the rain
                    made everything cold and wet.</p>
                <p>Still, there&rsquo;s a race to finish. The team puts the car back together with time to spare and
                    even has a
                    chance to change the gear ratio one more time before Cody squeezes back in the driver&rsquo;s seat.
                </p>
                <p>Gary pushes Cody to the starting position as his crew walks to the grandstand to watch.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon dad, please win,&rdquo; Carter says from the bleachers as he watches each car
                    begin the
                    formation lap.</p>
                <p>Cody starts on the inside of the seventh row. He is sitting mid-pack at the start of the race, but
                    hoped to
                    pass most, if not all, of the people in front of him.</p>
                <p>Lately, he&rsquo;s been telling himself to &ldquo;keep passing cars until you can&rsquo;t pass no
                    more or
                    bring it back on a wrecker.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a motto that works.</p>
                <p>It is almost time to hit the throttle, and everything starts to slow down again. He waits for the
                    stoplight
                    to turn green, signaling the start of the race. He would need to be quick on the throttle to get in
                    a good
                    position for the first turn.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;He just looks real squirrelly,&rdquo; Payton replies.</p>
                <p>She&rsquo;s right. Minutes later, his family watches Cody crest the edge of the track, retire early
                    and
                    approach the pits. His crew jumps up and hustles to meet him there. It had been going so well, but
                    an early
                    exit means Cody would finish at the back of the pack.</p>
                <p>A flooded motor and punctured tire left him with little to fight for on the track. He suspected
                    something had
                    gone wrong with the rocker, but he wouldn&rsquo;t know until he went back to the shop and dissected
                    it.
                    He&rsquo;s set to race the same car the next day at Paragon Speedway in Morgan County, but that
                    means he has a
                    long night of troubleshooting ahead of him.</p>
                <p>It&rsquo;s a disappointing end to the day, but not uncommon &mdash; even for regular winners like
                    Cody.
                    Though he had hoped to finish the race, he is optimistic that the repairs will get done in time.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;That's the whole thing with racing,&rdquo; Cody said. &ldquo;You never know what's going to
                    happen. It
                    takes one little thing, and then you're out of contention for everything.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>His crew begins to pack up as the race winner is announced over loudspeakers. The crowd roars as the
                    driver
                    receives a giant check for $10,000. Cody, on the other hand, walks away with $700.</p>

                    <p>The championship is over but tomorrow brings a new chance to chase those few moments where time
                    stands still
                    for Cody. His crew has no doubt he&rsquo;ll be on the podium again very soon.</p>
                <p>Cody hugs his boys goodbye as they leave with Payton, and he parts ways with the rest of his crew,
                    including
                    crew member Jeff McCloud, Barry and Gary. Most of them will see each other the next day to help Cody
                    try to
                    secure another win.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow?&rdquo; Jeff asks.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow,&rdquo; Cody says.</p>
