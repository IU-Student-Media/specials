                <p>
                    On a late Friday evening in a cozy two-bedroom apartment on the south side of Bloomington, and far
                    from the clamor of
                    Kirkwood Avenue and the house parties happening just off campus, 24-year-old IU sophomore Bennett
                    Larsen laboriously
                    tinkered with a 1-1/2-foot tall model robot from the anime series “Gundam.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    The model — one of dozens seemingly occupying every inch of free space around the apartment — was
                    made up of almost a
                    hundred individual parts that Larsen would carefully piece together over the course of a few days.
                    Depending on the size
                    and complexity of the model, he estimates assembling a model can take from two hours to a week. His
                    ideal night consists
                    of five hours of model-making — no interruptions.

                    other who he said
                    enabled his addiction at times. He now has a girlfriend who supports his efforts to remain sober.

                    model of
                    this size would only take a few hours to build.
                    <strong>BOTTOM MIDDLE</strong> Larsen looks at the individual weapons and pieces he has yet to cut
                    out and assemble
                    on one of his recent models. He said it takes time, but he enjoys the focus it takes to build them.

                    his kitchen table
                    as he works on his most recent ones. They often come with dozens of parts he individually
                    assembles.

                <p>
                    Larsen first came to Bloomington as a part-time Ivy Tech student before becoming addicted to
                    marijuana and subsequently
                    leaving the school and his internship program. He had smoked it once before coming to the city, but
                    once he began
                    smoking regularly at college, he found it difficult to stop.

                <p>
                    “It turned from a couple times a month to every weekend to most nights,” Larsen said. “One time my
                    friend and I ran into each other on our way to our internship group first thing in the morning and
                    we looked at each other and went to his room to get high.”

                    Drug and party culture in Bloomington is like a snowball rolling down a hill: once it starts
                    rolling, it’s nearly
                    impossible to stop after a certain point. IU is known as a prominent party school, ranking in the
                    top 20 party schools
                    in the nation by <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/top-party-schools-america-1619664">Newsweek</a>

                    . Larsen’s struggles to maintain his sobriety while in a college town is not
                    uncommon; any all-encompassing culture only leaves stragglers that much more to the wayside.

                    Bloomington is a town where drinking and partying are omnipresent, especially for college students.
                    Kirkwood Avenue,
                    downtown's central roadway with a myriad of bars, is packed almost every night with people wandering
                    between bars or drinking
                    in the street.

                    “After midnight you tend to see a lot of extremely inebriated people,” Luke Van Den Eeden, IU
                    student and bouncer
                    at Brothers Bar and Grill, said. “Social life in Bloomington involves a lot of alcohol.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    “The party culture here in Bloomington seems mildly unsafe, so when I go out I don’t go out by
                    myself,” local Alyssa
                    Gartner said while bar hopping following the homecoming football game in October. “Indiana
                    University is known for being
                    one of the largest party colleges in the world.”

                    Ceremonies and celebrations are just excuses for crowds of people to get wildly drunk, IU junior
                    Abby Bloomer said. She
                    hadn’t had a drop of alcohol until the day she graduated from high school, but her drinking became a
                    problem when she
                    started attending IU.

                    “My first year was awful: there were no in-person classes, I was stuck in this tiny dorm by myself
                    and I felt like the only thing entertaining I could do was alcohol,” Bloomer, now a junior, said
                    about her first months at IU. “When you don’t have any responsibilities, it’s fine to drink Friday,
                    Saturday, and Sunday if that’s your regular party weekend.”

                    for next. But I thought I was happy because I was high.”

                            Bennett Larsen struggles with the idea of falling back into addiction. Earlier, Larsen began
                            playing the soundtrack to the game Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, the first vinyl he bought

                    The simple act of walking across campus is enough to remind Larsen of his struggles to avoid
                    marijuana since the smell
                    of the drug is strong, distinguishable and common. Although marijuana possession is illegal in
                    Indiana, many local
                    dispensaries are legally able to sell versions of the product with a small enough amount of THC
                    concentration, commonly
                    known as Delta 8.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Larsen found it difficult to quit smoking for the sake of others, and he was unwilling to seek
                    recovery until he wanted
                    it for himself. This is common for many people in Narcotics Anonymous, Larsen said.

                    Larsen said he became convinced to quit marijuana one morning when he found himself smoking a bowl

                    window seemingly without a care in the world.

                    “It was 9 a.m. in the morning, I’m sitting on the couch with the blinds completely open. I’m sitting
                    there, in my underwear, and I’m smoking a bowl. Some form of clarity came to me in that moment and I
                    realized it was the beginning of the day and I’m practically naked, on display for anyone walking by
                    and we live next to a relatively busy road, and I’m smoking, doing something that is illegal in this
                    state,” Larsen said. “That was the first time I ever really felt true shame for drug use, and I
                    realized that maybe things need to change.”

                        substances like alcohol and cannabis are present. But what about the students who are recovering

                    The road to recovery looks different for everyone, Lindsay Potts said, director of Behavioral Health

                    “Recovery is any action toward growth. There are thousands of ways for people to live in
                    recovery,” Potts said. “Therapy, group therapy and peer support offer resources to individuals to
                    find their path forward.”

                    IU Health’s Addiction Treatment and Recovery Centers treat addiction as a symptom of other issues,
                    supervisor Andrea
                    Cheek said. Their recovery program encompasses a six to eight week intensive outpatient care course
                    which often involves
                    multiple weekly meetings and check-ups. Following this program, patients go through a less intensive
                    aftercare program
                    for two to three months.

                    “We try to help patients build a support network and help them replace drugs with something more

                    something to fill in the gap of that relationship relapses become more likely.”

                    Larsen attends weekly Narcotics Anonymous meetings and works with the Collegiate Recovery Community
                    to connect with
                    others who are avoiding substance abuse on and around campus. The NA meetings, he says, are more
                    rigorous and include a
                    wider variety of people, but the CRC offers a space for IU students and allows them to talk about

                                        <p>"And some of these are like, "Whoa, you were in the pits." Like, I spent

                                            months of my life essentially homeless and another 6 years still not on
                                            a lease but with my current roommate. Um, like, but three of those months I
                                            was not living with my family and they were not providing me financial
                                            support. And I was living with a boyfriend who resented my wealthier
                                            upbringing."</p>

                                        <p>"And thats where my using got me, and it still took me like a year after that
                                            to actually go to meetings and stop. But then you read stories in here about
                                            people who had only one piece of clothing and it was a dress. And it wasnt
                                            even a dress it was a ratty tube top. "</p>

                    Getting clean was not a simple process for Larsen. To avoid the temptation of using, he began
                    spending more time with
                    friends he made through his connections in the recovery community and stopped seeing people whose
                    relationship with him
                    was based solely on their mutual drug usage.

                    “There were many, many relapses between my decision to get clean and my first long stint of
                    sobriety,” Larsen said. “I decided for myself that I wanted my life to be better, I wanted to go
                    to school, that I didn’t want to work at Arby’s anymore. It was a good job, but it was not
                    conducive to a clean mindset.”

                    Students who seek recovery often do so at the behest of others, such as friends or family, Cheek
                    said. These patients
                    tend to be less self-motivated in their recovery, which can be an impediment in their sobriety.

                    Larsen and Bloomer found it difficult to pursue recovery without an internal motivation. Bloomer
                    chose to seek recovery
                    because she found she didn’t like the person she was becoming when she drank.

                <p>
                    “I had this intense fear of coming down from being drunk so I would just continue drinking as
                    the night went on. A lot of things happened that I didn’t remember, someone told me that I
                    kissed someone, a lot of specific things I did that very much were not me, that didn’t reflect
                    who I was,” Bloomer said. “That was when I realized that I couldn’t keep doing this.”

                                            recover from substance use. But I was like, I am spending so much less time
                                            consciously with my cats."</p>

                                        <p>"Because I'd be like high, and then go to bed. And sure I'd pet them and love
                                            on them, but I was so high that it wasn't like meaningful."</p>

                                        <p> "I'm the type of person, I sit down at the end of the night and I make sure
                                            both my cats know that I verbalize that I am like thankful for their
                                            presence. And I will do my best to love them for as much as I can for every

                                        <p>"And so I think realizing, like "oh my god, I am not following through on
                                            that." They might still be getting love but its not as sincere, its not as
                                            purposeful and if they had a need I might not understand it as well because
                                            I am high."</p>

                                        <p> "I think that was something that was huge in the changing, was my cats."</p>

                    Recovering from high drug usage is not a linear process and being in recovery isn’t as black and
                    white as either being
                    dependent or completely abstinent from a substance, Bloomer said. People like her favor an approach
                    she calls being
                    “sober-ish” which is the gradual process of weaning off of problematic substances without quiting
                    outright.

                    For others like Larsen, seeking sobriety is a goal which supersedes all others. In his pursuit
                    of recovering from marijuana addiction he has cut ties with friends and significant others who
                    he felt wouldn’t be conducive to his recovery. His most recent relapse occurred when he was
                    drunk, so he quit drinking altogether to eliminate one more route to relapse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “There is a scale of relapsing that ranges from someone using one time after months of sobriety
                    or to someone falling back into dependence,” Larsen said. “I’m not taking the risk either way.
                    For me, my recovery relies on being completely sober.”
