                    <h3>IU’s motto is lux et veritas — light and truth. But as a public university, IU’s multiple
                        violations of public access laws, delays and denials fly in the face of its motto’s commitment
                        to transparency.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The Indiana Daily Student requests far more records from IU than any other single news outlet or
                        company, according to IU’s own data. We request records to make our stories more fair, more
                        factual, more nuanced and more interesting. We want to believe the university sees us as
                        partners in the pursuit of light and truth.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite our newsroom’s best efforts, we can’t get any evidence that they engage with us in good
                        faith. The anecdotal evidence we have points in the opposite direction.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the IDS currently, there are several reporters waiting on records they requested months ago,
                        some of which they have never heard back about other than automated responses saying the request
                        was received. One recently filed a complaint with public access counselor Luke Britt, who has
                        already determined IU violated public access laws multiple times this academic year.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier this year, IU argued that it wasn’t obligated to determine whether a student code of conduct violation — sexual assault — falls under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act’s category of a “crime of violence” when an IDS reporter requested a student’s disciplinary records. Also this academic year, IU approved a contract worth $500,000 of public university funds to former IU President Michael McRobbie without a public meeting, which was in violation of the Open Door Law. 

                    </p>
                    <p>IU spokesperson Chuck Carney said in an email that IU has answered thousands of public records
                        requests and dozens of public access counselor complaints, with the majority upholding IU’s
                        responses.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “IU remains committed to complying with the Indiana Access to Public Records Act and Open Door
                        Law,” Carney wrote.

                    </p>
                    <p>Britt said anecdotally, agencies tend to defer to his advisory opinions, and IU accounts for just
                        a few complaints every year.

                    </p>
                    <p>But compliance with the letter of the law doesn’t mean transparency or timeliness.

                    <p>What if we could determine, quantitatively, whether IU treats different classes of requesters
                        differently? And not just that — what if we could calculate average response times, or quantify
                        whether some topics are harder to get your hands on regardless of what type of requester you
                        are? That’s what we were originally planning to do — write a data-driven news story.
                    </p>
                    <h3>We can’t, yet, because IU doesn’t track the status of requests in a public records log. But here’s how we tried.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Many public agencies maintain a document called a case log or public records log, which catalogs
                        the details of all the requests the agency receives and when and how they complete that request.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On March 1, a month after requesting IU’s public records log, we received a document generated
                        from IU’s public records portal and cataloging every records request received since 2015.
                        Because this was the document responsive to our request, we believed it was IU’s public records
                        log. Carney said it isn’t.



                    </p>
                    <p>Regardless of what it is, it can’t be used to evaluate IU’s record quantitatively because it
                        contained no column indicating when or whether requests had been fulfilled.
                    </p>
                    <p>Public agencies have no obligation to keep such logs. But other state agencies which have
                        produced public records logs — including the <a
                            href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/indiana-152/public-records-log-indiana-state-police-110461/#files">Indiana

                            the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration </a>
                        — include columns indicating when and how requests were completed. Some other public
                        universities,
                        including the <a href="https://publicrecords.uoregon.edu/requests">University of Oregon</a> and
                        the <a href="https://publicrecordsrequests.iowa.uiowa.edu/Log">University of Iowa,</a> maintain
                        records logs on public-facing, frequently updated webpages.

                    </p>
                    <p>To submit an open records request to IU, a requester fills out a form on the Office of the Vice
                        President and General Counsel website. That request appears in the general counsel’s email inbox
                        and Amelia Marvel, assistant general counsel, is the attorney who monitors that email account.
                    </p>
                    <p>Marvel pulled the document she provided to us from that system, which doesn’t track the
                        completion of requests.
                    </p>
                    <p>Marvel said she maintains her own personal document to track requests, and Carney said “an attorney” maintains a personal log to track requests. When we asked on a phone call about our original request if she could provide that document in response to this request or a new request, she said it would be privileged, or exempt from disclosure.

                    </p>
                    <p>The IDS is not suggesting that IU does not properly manage its records requests on an internal, organizational level. But we find it strange that IU doesn’t maintain this information in the kind of log that other agencies have made available when they received a request for one. It is strange that in response to our request for IU’s public records log or case log, Marvel provided a document that is not a case log and did not correct us when we referenced it as such in communications with her. It is strange that when we repeatedly clarified that we were primarily interested in tracking information and not responsive records to specific requests in the document, Marvel didn’t provide her log or even mention that it existed until we discussed the request on the phone on April 18, even though it seems to contain exactly the information we requested. It is unclear to us why a document concerning public records maintained by a public employee would be privileged. 

                    </p>
                    <p>Carney said IU can access the date requests were fulfilled via the email from which it responds to public records requests. 
                    </p>
                    <p>“The Indiana APRA requires that we provide responsive public records, not information about what public records are requested and fulfilled. IU is fulfilling its obligations to record requests, which consists of more than 700 requests a year. The complexity of requests, consideration of state and federal laws that concern student and staff privacy, and myriad other factors may prolong fulfillment of a request,” Carney wrote.

                    <p>Because IU could or would not provide data on completion of requests, the IDS narrowed its scope
                        to requests in the log related to sexual misconduct, disciplinary records and Title IX, which
                        encompassed 170 of the over 3,000 requests to the university. We narrowed the records based on
                        keywords, so this may exclude related requests that don’t use the specific words we used as
                        filters.
                    </p>
                    <p>On March 22, we requested to see responses to those 170 requests so we could hand-code a column indicating when the requests were completed and to what extent the requested records were provided. We followed up several times between then and April 18, when Marvel called to discuss the request.   

                    </p>
                    <p>As of publication, over three months after the initial request for the log and a month after the
                        narrowed request, none of those records had been provided.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Here’s what we do know. Our experience requesting records from IU is shaped by two factors: The
                        Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and the fact that we are student journalists.
                    </h3>
                    <p>FERPA prevents the release of student academic and disciplinary records except in the case of a
                        violent crime or non-forcible sexual offense. As an educational institution, many IU records are
                        subject to FERPA — but IU stretches that connection to records that have no meaningful
                        connection to a student’s education.
                    </p>
                    <p>“In many ways, FERPA is just this all-purpose excuse for a school to deny access to any record
                        that they simply want to deny access to. And all of a sudden, that magically transforms into
                        some sort of education record,” Mike Hiestand, senior legal counsel at the Student Press Law
                        Center, said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier this year, the IDS published an investigation titled <a
                            href="https://specials.idsnews.com/iu-jacobs-school-dissonance-in-due-process/">“Dissonance
                            in Due Process.”</a> The investigation revealed IU’s mishandling of sexual assault cases in the Jacobs School of Music. Student Chris Parker was found responsible of sexual assault by IU’s Title IX hearing process when he was a freshman. Parker then violated his suspension, meaning he shouldn’t have been allowed to return to IU or that he should have a police record. He was allowed to return, and he doesn’t have a police record. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While reporting that story, IDS reporter Cate Charron requested Parker’s disciplinary records. Her request was denied. In denying Charron the records, IU argued it wasn’t obligated to determine whether a student code of conduct violation — sexual assault — falls under FERPA’s definition of a violent crime. 


                    </p>
                    <p>“That’s absolutely ludicrous,” Hiestand said of that argument. “Shame on their lawyers.”

                        The public access counselor determined IU had <a

                        hasn’t released the records, or any records in connection with several other of Charron’s
                        requests related to this story.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second factor limiting our access to records is that we are students. Hiestand said
                        universities know they can try to run out the clock.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Students come and students go, and they know that if they can outwait them, oftentimes the
                        request will go away,” Hiestand said.

                    </p>
                    <p> Carney denied that IU treats student journalists differently than other requesters. But the idea
                        that universities hold out on student requesters — a main source of higher education
                        reporting — is conventional wisdom among student journalists and our advocates.

                    </p>
                    <h3>When we narrowed our request, we chose to focus on sexual misconduct and disciplinary records
                        because getting university records related to sexual misconduct has been difficult nationwide
                        for decades.

                    </h3>
                    <p>Hiestand said since the early 1990s, schools nationwide have fought hard to avoid releasing
                        records related to Title IX and argued that even campus police records were exempt from
                        disclosure due to FERPA — making the claim that somehow these were educational records or
                        student disciplinary records.


                    </p>
                    <p>“They’ve been very successful in setting up these internal judiciary systems that function as
                        black holes,” Hiestand said, and student journalists around the country have played an important
                        role in getting some of this information released.

                        Sexual misconduct and Title IX have been the topic of multiple important IDS investigations in
                        recent years. For “Dissonance in due process” earlier this year, Charron received none of the
                        records she requested. Requests related to <a
                            href="http://specials.idsnews.com/the-system/">“The System,”</a> which was published in
                        2016, were partially fulfilled.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For another sexual misconduct investigation in October 2020, IU alumna and former IDS editor in
                        chief Emily Isaacman requested disciplinary records for a professor who IU found to have <a
                            href="http://specials.idsnews.com/iu-theater-department-sexual-harassment-title-ix/">“a
                            concerning pattern”</a> of sexual harrassment. Isaacman received those records in a timely
                        manner — but her case is unusual compared to other attempts to get disciplinary or sexual
                        misconduct-related records.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Carley Lanich is an IU alumna, former IDS staffer and current education reporter at the South
                        Bend Tribune. When Lanich was a reporter at the IDS, she wrote “The System,” which outlined IU’s
                        process of investigating and disciplining campus sexual assault.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the time, IU’s Title IX process was under five investigations by the federal Office of Civil
                        Rights, and former university administrator Jason Casares who oversaw the sexual misconduct
                        hearings had recently resigned after being accused of sexual misconduct himself at a conference.
                        Lanich requested Human Resources complaints and grievances about Casares and some of Casares’s
                        emails, but she never received any of them.



                    </p>
                    <p>In her time working at the IDS, Lanich spoke with IU officials to discuss the best way for
                        reporters to formulate requests and make them as easy as possible to fulfill.

                    </p>

                    <p>“They have a lot on their plate when they’re filling requests,” Lanich said. “We made sure we did
                        everything on our part to explain where we were coming from and tried to be good partners in the
                        sharing of information.”

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In reporting “The System,” she focused on obtaining things like training materials and names of
                        people serving on disciplinary panels. Lanich said IU’s response to her extensive request was
                        partially fulfilled, and she got more than she expected to get based on her past experience. But
                        she didn’t even try to get student records from IU, she said.

                        Serial meetings are when public officials meet in small groups that don’t include enough of the
                        members to meet quorum, meaning the meetings weren’t technically subject to the Open Door Law.

                    <p>
                        The incident became emblematic of the problem with serial meetings and helped prompt the
                        legislature to close that loophole, which IU came to support, Key said.

                    <p>This year, IU violated the Open Door Law when it approved a contract of over half a million
                        dollars for former president Michael McRobbie outside of a public meeting. Then, it violated
                        APRA when it took too long providing records to IU Maurer School of Law professor Steve Sanders.

                    <p>IU’s former general counsel Jackie Simmons was <a

                            terminated without cause </a>in December 2021 after she made disparaging remarks about
                        Sanders during the dispute over his complaints to the public access counselor.
                    </p>
                    <p>Britt said after the Sanders and Charron cases, IU reached out to him for a meeting. They met
                        March 8, after the new vice president and general counsel Anthony Prather took office. Britt
                        said the lawyers who met with him were open to suggestions and the meeting was productive and
                        encouraging.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prather declined to be interviewed for this story, but Carney said that meeting was to discuss whether IU’s intended response to the request for Parker’s disciplinary records complied with APRA and Britt’s advisory opinion. In its most recent denial of the records, IU argued it didn’t have to release the records because Charron had already obtained the information elsewhere. 

                    </p>
                    <p>The process of trying to get IU’s public records log for this story encapsulates what we see as
                        the problem. It took a month to provide a document which we
                        ultimately found out isn’t even IU’s public records log. The document that probably does contain
                        the information we need, an attorney’s personal log, is supposedly privileged.
                    </p>
                    <h3>If it takes a month to get a document that isn’t what we requested, how can we trust the
                        university to provide the records that matter to the rest of our stories?
                    </h3>
                    <p>We are full-time students. For better or for worse, we have been known to skip classes and meals
                        and run out of groceries because of the amount of time we spend working to make this publication
                        excellent. Coming into the newsroom day after day and reporting to our editors that we still
                        haven’t gotten records that are important after months of waiting is, frankly, infuriating —
                        especially because the records that are hardest to get are often related to matters of student
                        safety.

                    </p>
                    <p>We have been taught to expect this. We have put up with lengthy delays and offensive arguments
                        from lawyers who should know better.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We opened this story with IU’s motto: light and truth. That’s because at the end of the day, we want to know why IU insists on keeping student journalists in the dark.
