                        Editor&rsquo;s note: Several women who spoke to the IDS wrestled with whether to use their full
                        names
                        in
                        this story throughout the reporting process. Ultimately, four women who shared their experience
                        with
                        sexual violence and the adjudication process requested full or partial anonymity. Two of them
                        chose
                        to be identified by their first names while one, Daisy, chose to be identified by a nickname.
                        Their
                        reasons for requesting anonymity were complex, ranging from fear of retaliation from the men
                        they
                        accused of sexual violence or people in positions of power to concerns that speaking out about
                        their
                        experience may impact their career in music.

                        target="_blank">reckoning in 2022</a> when students organized protests to demand a
                    better response to sexual violence within Jacobs. Two years later, a culture of sexual abuse
                    persists without much effective action from the Jacobs School, sources told the Indiana Daily
                    Student.</p>
                <p>The IDS reported this story for eight months, interviewing six women who directly experienced sexism,
                    harassment or assault from individuals within the Jacobs School of Music.</p>
                <p>Jacobs Dean Abra Bush pushed back on the characterization of the school in an interview with the IDS
                    but emphasized her commitment to helping students feel safe, pointing toward a new sexual misconduct
                    task force she organized over the summer.</p>
                <p>But despite efforts from Jacobs, several women described the issue of sexual abuse in the Jacobs
                    School as &ldquo;neverending.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Freshly graduated from her master&rsquo;s degree at Jacobs, Leah Warman wonders if her experience in
                    the jazz studies department would have been different if she was a man.</p>
                <p>IU&rsquo;s jazz studies department, in line with <a
                        href="https://theconversation.com/women-in-jazz-still-face-many-barriers-to-success-new-research-160732"
                        target="_blank">most jazz spaces</a> across the country, is
                    overwhelmingly male. Warman, a tuba performance and jazz studies master&rsquo;s student who said she
                    was one of a handful of women in the jazz studies department before she graduated in 2024, described
                    her experience as isolating and tokenizing.</p>
                <p>When news broke about Demondrae Thurman, a euphonium professor who was serving as the Jacobs
                    associate dean and brass department chair until
                    <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2024/05/demondrae-thurman-no-longer-serving-jacobs-school-of-music-sexual-misconduct-allegations"
                        target="_blank">
                        allegations of sexual misconduct</a> led to his April
                    departure, it only intensified Warman&rsquo;s feelings of alienation. Thurman had been a close
                    mentor and was involved in bringing Warman to the Jacobs School of Music after she received her
                    bachelor&rsquo;s from the University of Alabama.
                </p>
                <p>The allegations against Thurman came from former University of British Columbia music student Claire
                    Pollock in a Facebook post in April 2024. In it, she alleged Thurman had pressured her into sex six
                    years earlier, when Pollock was 18 and a senior in high school.</p>

                </div> -->

                <p>She told the IDS in April that she met Thurman when her band flew him into Alberta, Canada in 2018.
                    She claimed Thurman, married and in his 40s, had touched her thigh, made inappropriate comments,
                    performed oral sex on her in a hotel room and asked her to do the same for him. At the time, IU had

                <p>IU moved swiftly after Pollock shared her story. Jacobs Dean Abra Bush called a town hall the
                    following day and announced Thurman was no longer serving in his previous roles as of noon April 29.

                <p>Pollock quit music as a result of the experience. Years later, she confronted Thurman in a Facebook

                <p>Pollock blames a culture of hierarchy endemic to the music industry. In small music circles where
                    relationships are everything, Pollock said those who are aware of serial abusers fear speaking out
                    would harm their ability to advance their careers. It&rsquo;s an element of the industry that was
                    echoed by both established and student musicians the IDS spoke with. Pollock said it&rsquo;s an
                    attitude that must change to buck this &ldquo;<a

                <p class='section-break'>•••</p>
                <p>Though sexual assault, harassment and sexism have been reported in music schools and industries
                    across the country, sources described the jazz studies department as a particular hotspot for
                    misconduct.</p>
                <p>Some former Jacobs students, including alumna Abby Malala, described the jazz studies department as
                    the &ldquo;frat house&rdquo; of Jacobs. Jazz piano student Abhik Mazumder said he finds it hard to
                    study jazz due to the frequency of sexual assault allegations and actionless lip-service to social
                    equality.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Now I can&rsquo;t even detach the music I play from that kind of moral behavior,&rdquo;
                    Mazumder said.</p>
                <p>The issue may be a byproduct of the culture itself which can play a role in facilitating sexual
                    violence, Zoë Peterson of the Kinsey Institute said. Peterson, who researches sexual violence at the
                    institute, said men are more likely to perpetrate sexual violence if they are part of a peer group
                    where men are supporting violence against women, particularly in male-dominated groups. These spaces
                    can be rife with sexism and &ldquo;sexual assault-supportive attitudes,&rdquo; which includes
                    victim-blaming or dismissing sexual assault allegations.</p>

                </div>
                <p>To Malala, even when people are not intentional enablers, they can struggle to come to terms with the
                    fact that they live among people who commit sexual violence &mdash; especially when it involves
                    someone
                    talented and successful.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Even if they&rsquo;re not guilty of those things, I think they are invested in protecting each
                    other because when the time comes, or if the time comes that they abuse their power, they want to
                    know that they have put themselves in an environment where they will be supported in their
                    abuse,&rdquo; she said.</p>
                <p>It takes a village to abuse someone, Malala said.</p>

                <p>Daisy had expected to feel relieved once IU&rsquo;s months-long investigation into the student she
                    reported for sexual assault concluded. But when IU expelled the student, a jazz studies major when
                    the assault occurred in February 2023, the former IU student found herself still afraid.</p>
                <p>Included in Daisy&rsquo;s Title IX case was a recording she took of a January 2024 phone call with
                    the perpetrator, Solomon Keim, in which he does not deny sexually assaulting her and admits to
                    raping multiple people.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have raped a lot of people,&rdquo; Keim said in the recording, which was obtained by
                    the IDS. &ldquo;And broken a lot of people.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Keim did not respond to a list of allegations sent to him by the IDS over email and text.</p>
                <p>Keim&rsquo;s case is not the only Title IX investigation into a Jacobs student since the IDS
                    published their first investigation on Jacobs in January 2022.</p>
                <p>In February 2022, a female Jacobs student, who requested total anonymity for fear of retaliation,
                    reported a sexual assault by another Jacobs student. IU found him responsible for both sexual
                    assault and harassment, and issued him a two-year suspension after a nearly 11-month investigation.
                    While she waited for a hearing, she was forced to remain in the same classes and ensembles as her
                    abuser, she said.</p>
                <p>When IU suspended the perpetrator in January 2023, it did not inform any faculty members, she said,
                    giving her abuser the opportunity to &ldquo;write his own story&rdquo; of the reason behind his
                    departure. She said he told one professor he was dropping out of school for mental health reasons.
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;Which to me felt like a slap in the face,&rdquo; she said.</p>
                <p>As she waited for the investigation to conclude, she felt unsafe each day she had to be around her
                    abuser. The prolonged contact interrupted the healing process, she said.</p>

                        &mdash; one that is both re-traumatizing and often fails to enact lasting change.&rdquo;</p>
                </div>
                <p>&ldquo;There are two worlds in Jacobs: one that is actively witnessing and experiencing violence and
                    misogyny in their educational environment and one that is willfully unaware of its existence around
                    them,&rdquo; the student wrote in a text to the IDS. &ldquo;Educating the unaware becomes another
                    heavy burden to carry for survivors – one that is both re-traumatizing and often fails to enact
                    lasting change.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Some women who report their assaults are told there is not enough evidence to discipline the alleged
                    perpetrator. The impact of going through a sometimes year-long investigation process only to receive
                    a negative outcome can be devastating, two women told the IDS.</p>
                <p>To university Title IX Coordinator Jennifer Kincaid, one sexual misconduct case is too many.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the goal, right, is just to have every student come here and not be impacted by
                    sexual violence,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Unfortunately, a societal problem doesn&rsquo;t stop at our
                    doorstep or end when people leave here, and we just try to do our best work to help students, both
                    with prevention and if they experience sexual misconduct.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>While the process is critiqued both by victims and alleged perpetrators, gaps may be systemic rather
                    than intentional, according to Title IX experts.</p>
                <p>Justin Brown, the director of civil rights and Title IX at Denison University in Ohio, said
                    it&rsquo;s easy for administrators to talk about wanting to stop sexual violence, but that
                    universities are not financially incentivized to work on prevention efforts.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Those platitudes are very easy, but for the people actually doing the work, they&rsquo;re
                    mostly meaningless unless backed up with support and resources,&rdquo; he said.</p>
                <p>People who work on sexual violence prevention and response efforts are underpaid, with overall
                    efforts being understaffed and underfunded, Brown said. Ideally, sexual violence prevention
                    programming would go beyond orientation, with touchpoints through sophomore, junior and senior year.
                    But additional pressures on educational institutions, like opposition to diversity, equity and
                    inclusion initiatives or keeping up with college rankings and donors, can impede the effort for
                    substantive change, Brown said.</p>
                <p>Though universities face major trouble if they fail to satisfy Title IX requirements, there are no
                    consequences for universities who don&rsquo;t provide prevention efforts to begin with. Brown said
                    it&rsquo;s not an intentional choice &mdash; many administrators think the work is being done and
                    just
                    aren&rsquo;t devoting the time to take stock of their gaps.</p>
                <p>While the IU Office for Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy offers an array of
                    opportunities to become educated on issues of sexual violence prevention and consent, few programs
                    are mandatory. Besides a training module on sexual violence, drugs and alcohol required for
                    first-year and transfer students, one of the only other ways all students are educated about sexual
                    violence is the It&rsquo;s On Us Bystander Intervention Program for new students living in residence
                    halls. Students have always been expected to participate but IU only made the program mandatory in
                    2023, the office&rsquo;s director Sally Thomas said.</p>
                <p>In an effort to understand the work being done within the jazz studies department, the IDS reached
                    out to all jazz faculty members May 1, asking for an interview to discuss what has been done to
                    prevent sexual assault and improve the environment for women. Only Tom Walsh, the department&rsquo;s
                    chair, agreed to comment, providing a statement four months after the IDS initially reached out. On
                    Sep. 17, Walsh said he would be happy to speak to the IDS over the phone as long as it was
                    off-the-record. When the IDS agreed to the call, Walsh suddenly changed course and refused.</p>
                <p>In the statement, Walsh wrote that he invited Sally Thomas to give a mandatory presentation on
                    consent to jazz studies majors in the fall of 2022 and 2023. The jazz studies department also hired
                    Natalie Boeyink, the department&rsquo;s only female tenure-track professor, in 2023. Other changes
                    Walsh highlighted included more female guest artists, offering playing opportunities and
                    scholarships to women in the department and an increased &ldquo;presence of women in the photographs
                    displayed in (the) combo room.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;While we can&rsquo;t force anyone to behave in a certain way outside of our classrooms, we can
                    convey values that we believe will benefit each individual and the whole community,&rdquo; Walsh
                    wrote in the statement.</p>

                <p>During the summer of 2024, after the IDS had reached out to IU officials for comment and in the wake
                    of the Demondrae Thurman allegations, Jacobs Dean Abra Bush created the Task Force on Sexual
                    Misconduct. The task force&rsquo;s goal was to analyze the culture of the school and recommend
                    solutions. Their final recommendations, according to an August 2024 email Bush sent to Jacobs
                    students, staff and faculty, included developing guidelines for social interactions between faculty
                    and students, creating a code of conduct for visiting artists and providing education and training.
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;The creation of this task force was not in response to any one incident but rather an
                    acknowledgement that work needs to be done in this area at the Jacobs School of Music,&rdquo; she
                    wrote in the email.</p>
                <p>In an interview with the IDS in September, Bush claimed the task force had been planned for a long
                    time. However, she could not give a specific timeframe for when the planning began.</p>
                <p>Bush said she takes the issue of sexual misconduct very seriously and listed efforts taken by the
                    school in recent years, such as diversifying faculty and creating a policy specifying appropriate
                    and inappropriate touch. When asked if she believed the Jacobs School or the music industry in
                    general had a particular issue with sexual abuse, she said she had no way of knowing what was
                    happening at other schools and pushed back on the idea that sexual assault was more frequent in
                    music.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I do think that when people have significant professional profiles, sometimes these issues are
                    more public than they are in other parts of organizations or at the university, for example,&rdquo;
                    she said.</p>
