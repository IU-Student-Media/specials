            Mortimer Octavius looks outside from the doorway of Casey Green's bedroom Oct. 5, 2024, in Bloomington.
            Morty spent the majority of the afternoon peeking out the back door, only coming outside a few times to walk
            along the back of the house and then go back inside.

                <p>The first thing Michael Clarke noticed as he stood in front of the Bloomington home was the smell of
                    skin infection.</p>
                <p>With his first steps inside, the animal control officer also quickly picked up the smell of feces. Of
                    urine. Of ammonia. His eyes watered as he moved further into the home.</p>
                <p>Stepping over the straw and excrement covering the floors, Clarke looked at the chaotic scene in
                    front of him &mdash; and dozens of dogs stared right back at him.</p>
                <p>Some of the dogs, mostly Carolina dogs, sat in wired cages. Others strode throughout the two-bedroom
                    house, their eyes tracking the officers as they walked across the room.</p>

                        The 627-sqaure-foot house where Morty and the other 67 Carolina dogs were found is seen Oct. 6,
                        2024, at North Adams Street in Bloomington. Each dog had approximately 9 square feet or three
                        feet by three feet, about the size of a kitchen cabinet door.

                        The dogs, ranging in age from adults to puppies, were seized by local law enforcement on March
                        16, 2023 and brought to the Bloomington Animal Shelter, which was overwhelmed with the amount of
                        dogs.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In the kitchen, a large male Carolina dog with pointed ears paced back and forth. His black fur coat
                    was marked by light brown on his paws, chest and face &mdash; two small patches above his eyes
                    almost resembled eyebrows. Though his path was somewhat obstructed by a wire cage, he walked,
                    panicked, close to where another dog lay under the sink with her litter of puppies.</p>
                <p>Clarke put a pile of nylon rope leashes down on a kitchen counter. He&rsquo;d start by trying to take
                    this dog out of the house first. But as he slipped the leash over the dog&rsquo;s neck, the Carolina
                    dog dropped to the ground. He started alligator rolling and pushed away.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He will be difficult and may bite, none of them have ever been on leashes,&rdquo; the
                    homeowner told officers.</p>
                <p>It took several officers to carry the dog, flailing, out of the house and into a plastic carrier
                    waiting to transport him to the Bloomington Animal Shelter. Though the homeowner had given officers
                    names for some of the dogs as they brought each one out; others didn&rsquo;t have names yet and the
                    animal shelter would rename many of them.</p>
                <p>As officers coaxed the dog into a carrier to transport him back to the shelter, there were 67 dogs
                    waiting back in the house &mdash; assigning each dog a number would have to suffice for a short
                    while. The officers made a note and headed back into the house.</p>
                <p>Dog number one was accounted for. Now just 67 more.</p>

                    the doorway of his foster mom, Casey Green's, house Oct. 5, 2024, in Bloomington. Casey said Morty
                    is her longest-term foster, but she can't keep him because of her job and the possibility of moving.
                    "I want to keep him so desperately," Casey said. "But, I can’t guarantee the stability long-term
                    right now.”

                <p>Every day, animal shelter and control representatives in Bloomington and across the country see the
                    harm humans can inflict on animals.</p>
                <p>Maybe a resident, struggling with mental health, accumulates more animals than they can feasibly take
                    care of, crowding dozens of pets into a single room. Sometimes a family decides their lifestyle is
                    incompatible with a young, energetic puppy and turns it into an overflowing shelter. In some cases,
                    animal control finds an animal already deceased, physically abused by a previous owner.</p>
                <p>The Bloomington Animal Shelter was already nearing capacity when animal control and local police
                    seized 68 dogs, mostly Carolina dogs, in March 2023 from what people familiar with the case
                    described as the largest animal hoarding complaint ever received in Monroe County.</p>
                <p>In every case, the shelter tries to heal some of this harm. But these 68 dogs tested this ability.
                    Perhaps no dog tested this more than this first dog, who now goes by a different name: Mortimer (but
                    many call him &ldquo;Morty&rdquo;).</p>
                <p>Almost two years after the initial seizure, the rest of the Carolina dogs have slowly disappeared
                    from the shelter&rsquo;s list of adoptable animals &mdash; a sign of success. But though he was the
                    first one taken out of the house by animal control, Morty&rsquo;s page remains, the last of the dogs
                    from the seizure waiting on adoption. It&rsquo;s left
                    those close to him wondering: can they help him find a home?</p>

                        in the doorway majority of the time his dog friends were outside, only briefly coming outside a
                        couple times and then running back to the kitchen.

                <p>Clarke had started his job at Bloomington Animal Control a month and a half before a woman called his
                    department to deliver a complaint that, at first, didn&rsquo;t seem like anything out of the
                    ordinary.</p>
                <p>She had purchased a dog from Robert Pryor, who was living in a two-bedroom home on North Adams
                    Street. She told animal control she could smell feces and urine from the home&rsquo;s front yard.
                </p>
                <p>Animal control and the Bloomington Animal Shelter had heard of Pryor before. In years past, he had
                    lived just outside of Monroe County. From 2018 to 2023, the shelter received at least 10 dogs
                    associated with him. But because he lived outside of Bloomington municipal limits, there
                    wasn&rsquo;t much they could do.</p>
                <p>The shelter also wasn&rsquo;t a stranger to animal hoarding and neglect situations. Even in
                    Bloomington, which had an ordinance banning the retail sale of cats and dogs until the state
                    legislature voided it this year, animal neglect is prominent. A shelter representative said animal
                    control officers respond to several thousand calls &mdash; ranging from reports of neglect, to stray
                    animals to animal infestations &mdash; each year.</p>
                <p>After receiving the complaint March 8, 2023, Officer Clarke and another animal control officer
                    approached the home, unsure of exactly what they would find. Immediately he noticed dirt buildup on
                    the home&rsquo;s windows, trash bags of dog food in the yard and insects flying around the property.
                </p>
                <p>After a few knocks, Pryor opened the front door.</p>
                <p>Clarke told Pryor he would need to fill out the proper litter and boarding application to keep the
                    animals in his home &mdash; and that he would need to schedule a required home inspection. They
                    wanted to give him a chance to keep his breeding business. Pryor, who officers and shelter
                    representatives
                    described as very cooperative and helpful, agreed. Pryor also told officers he planned to bring some
                    of the dogs to a Carolina dog rescue in South Carolina that month.</p>
                <p>The animal control officers didn&rsquo;t enter the home their first visit. But before Pryor closed
                    the door, Clarke noticed three Carolina dogs peering out at him.</p>
                <p>Carolina dogs are a relatively rare breed that are usually found living near the Georgia-South
                    Carolina border, according to the American Kennel Club, a not-for-profit dog breed registry. The
                    dogs are hesitant with strangers but adopt a pack mentality.</p>
                <p>Over the next few days, officers communicated with Pryor over the phone and email. In an email, Pryor
                    gave officers a list of seven adult dogs and 12 puppies that he planned to register. Then, officers
                    scheduled an animal permit home inspection for March 16, 2023.</p>
                <p>By the day of the scheduled home inspection, animal control and the shelter suspected the number of
                    animals at 227 N. Adams St. was much higher than the list Pryor gave them &mdash; especially when a
                    man arrived to the shelter the day of the inspection with a U-Haul carrying 10 dogs in wire cages,
                    most with skin infections and urine scalding. Pryor had asked him to hide the dogs until officers
                    finished the home visit, the man told animal control.</p>
                <p>The first day officers entered the home for the inspection, they tallied 50 dogs and puppies &mdash;
                    but the number rose to 68 when officers returned the next day to officially remove the animals.</p>
                <p>During the initial inspection, officers took photo evidence of the home and wrote affidavit
                    statements to obtain a seizure warrant, which judge Mary Ellen Diekhoff signed. However, when
                    officers reached out to Pryor, he said he would rather freely sign over all the Carolina dogs to the
                    shelter.</p>

            <div class="story">
                <p>When Morty and the other dogs arrived at the shelter on March 17, 2023, it was staggering.</p>
                <p>In addition to arriving with skin infections and urine scalding, one of the dogs from the seizure, a
                    dachshund, was in poor health and the veterinarian recommended euthanasia. Emily Herr, an outreach
                    coordinator who has worked at the shelter for 17 years, said she has seen seizures where the dogs
                    were in much worse physical condition. But Morty and the other dogs posed what she believes is a
                    bigger challenge for a local shelter: behavioral issues.</p>
                <p>Many of the dogs&rsquo; behavioral issues manifested as soon as officers entered the home for the
                    seizure. Some of the dogs seemed uncertain or scared to see a human being, Clarke said. Others, like
                    Morty, were terrified of leashes.</p>
                <p>For a small shelter with only 20 people on staff, these challenges could be much more time-intensive
                    and tougher to address than infection.</p>

                <p>After they placed as many dogs as possible in foster care, shelter staff identified eight dogs who
                    were &ldquo;struggling behaviorally the most.&rdquo; Morty was at the top of this list. Herr said he
                    could not even lift his head to look at the staff and volunteers who tried to meet him.</p>
                <p>Morty, like all the at-risk dogs at the shelter, received a team of four people. Their objective? To
                    help Morty
                    reach small goals &mdash; goals that might appear natural to other canines. One of Morty&rsquo;s
                    goals was simple: to wear a collar.</p>
                <p>Their strategy all depended on Morty&rsquo;s love for cheese whiz. First, a staff member would put a
                    collar on Morty. Then, before he could think about his new accessory, they would give him some
                    cheese wiz to eat, drawing his attention away. Then, they would take the collar off. And repeat.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He had very small goals in the beginning,&rdquo; Herr said. &ldquo;But piece by piece, they
                    all fill in and make almost a real dog.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Slowly, Morty came to accept the collar and would take on a new goal. But while Morty made progress,
                    some other dogs regressed. Herr said the shelter was forced to euthanize three Carolina dogs who
                    became &ldquo;offensively aggressive,&rdquo; trying to bite people with the intention to harm
                    &mdash; something that can be dangerous for shelter staff and potential foster and adoptive
                    families.</p>
                <p>The Bloomington Animal Shelter never turns away an animal and will hold an animal for at least five
                    days. After that, the shelter gives animals a behavior and health evaluation. Many of the animals
                    can be adopted or fostered, but if an animal is too sick, injured, aggressive or &ldquo;behaviorally
                    unsound&rdquo; the shelter considers euthanasia, stating it &ldquo;believes that euthanasia is the
                    most humane alternative to an existence of suffering and pain or being limited to life in a
                    cage.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Those were really, really hard decisions because obviously we want to take animals from a
                    situation like that and give them a better outcome and regardless, I still do think we did,&rdquo;
                    she said. &ldquo;We could at least provide them with a clean space to rest and food and water and
                    fresh air. And though they didn&rsquo;t want our love, we still love them.&rdquo;</p>

                        Morty hides around the corner of a wall in Green's house on Oct. 5, 2024, in Bloomington. When
                        he and the other dogs were rescued, they were taken to the Bloomington Animal Shelter. Now,
                        three-year-old Morty lives with his foster mom Casey Green and her dog Eleanor. Morty did not
                        step outside until four months after he had been living with Green. While he still struggles,
                        Morty has come a long way. He plays with his dog friends, snuggles with Green and runs around in
                        her backyard, but only when strangers aren't around.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In March 2024, Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb signed House Enrolled Act 1412. The law voided local
                    municipal ordinances that banned retail dog sales in Indiana &mdash; including Bloomington&rsquo;s
                    own ban on the retail sale of dogs. Critics argued the legislation protects inhumane puppy mills and
                    commercial breeders.</p>
                <p>The law will also make commercial dog breeders subject to random Indiana Board of Animal Health
                    inspections starting July 1, 2025. If breeders do not register with the Board of Animal Health, they
                    can face a Class A misdemeanor charge.</p>
                <p>However, Herr said many hoarding and breeding situations are not always straightforward.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I think the biggest misconception is that these people are monsters, and that&rsquo;s just not
                    the case,&rdquo; Herr said. &ldquo;When we look at people who end up in hoarding situations,
                    it&rsquo;s oftentimes a symptom of a much bigger problem that they&rsquo;re having. You know,
                    there&rsquo;s a lot of mental health issues that they&rsquo;re struggling with, there&rsquo;s a lot
                    of financial issues that they&rsquo;re struggling with.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Herr said she felt Pryor was unfairly targeted after the seizure, including when a broadcast news
                    team started taking video of Pryor&rsquo;s home.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I do think there were some ethical issues happening, but he was very cooperative, he was very
                    kind,&rdquo; Herr said. &ldquo;And he became a target in Bloomington. Even though the things he did
                    were not great, people did not treat him with any kind of respect at all.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Both Clarke and Herr said they believed Pryor did care for the dogs &mdash; that he thought he was
                    helping protect the Carolina breed. Clarke said when one of the Carolina dogs escaped from his
                    original foster home, Pryor had called the foster offering to help find the dog. He offered to send
                    the foster parent a voice recording of himself talking to get the dog to come back.</p>
                <p>“What kind of &lsquo;monster&rsquo; would reach back out like that and offer help?” Clarke said.
                    “That&rsquo;s not a
                    bad person, that&rsquo;s a person with a great heart who still cares, you know, and just wants to do
                    right. He wanted to make sure that those animals succeeded, and he thought he was doing that. He
                    thought he was saving the breed.”</p>

                <p>After the seizure, Pryor faced two different legal cases. In the first, he faced a civil charge for
                    violating Bloomington&rsquo;s local animal care ordinance, but this charge was dismissed. He was
                    later convicted of a Class A criminal misdemeanor for cruelty to an animal. He was sentenced to 180
                    days in the Monroe County Jail &mdash; but this term was suspended &mdash; and 180 days of
                    unsupervised probation.</p>
                <p>Pryor could not be reached for comment through a phone number associated with him.</p>
                <p class='section-break'>•••</p>

                <p>Although he came to her with the name &ldquo;Mortimer,&rdquo; Casey Green, Morty&rsquo;s foster mom,
                    thinks his middle name, Octavius, is more fitting for the canine. Green assigned him the name, which
                    he shares with a Roman emperor, when he started to come out of his shell this past year.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an Octavius,&rdquo; Green said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s regal, you know. That just
                    stuck.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>And one day in mid-September, Morty was living up to his courageous name: by leaving his bed in the
                    kitchen to catch a glimpse of the stranger standing in his living room.</p>
                <p>He started by peeking his head around the kitchen doorframe. Only for a second, though &mdash; he
                    didn&rsquo;t want the stranger to see him. And he succeeded: by the time his visitor looked in his
                    direction, Morty was already gone.</p>
                <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t good enough. His foster sister, Eleanor, was barking &mdash; what if she needed
                    his help? He obviously needed another quick peek around the doorframe. This time he waited for a few
                    seconds longer before bolting away.</p>
                <p>Still, he wanted to know more. So, Morty continued his game of cat-and-mouse for the next 30 minutes,
                    stuck between his curiosity and trepidation, before finally retiring back to his bed. Maybe
                    he&rsquo;d try again later.</p>
                <p>For another dog, the task might be easy and an opportunity to snag a few treats and pets. But for
                    Morty to even look at the newcomer from a distance, Green said, was &ldquo;brave.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Before coming to Green, Morty was in one other foster home for a few weeks. While he made significant
                    progress in the shelter setting, Herr said they didn&rsquo;t want to keep him there for long.</p>
                <p>That&rsquo;s when the shelter asked Green if she would be interested in taking him in. Green was
                    known among the shelter as one of the best animal foster parents in Bloomington. She&rsquo;s
                    fostered around 130 dogs &mdash; mostly puppies &mdash; since she was in college.</p>
                <p>She&rsquo;s fostered lots of dogs with complicated histories. Sometimes she takes in puppies whose
                    &ldquo;mama dog&rdquo; has tried to attack her litter. She&rsquo;s fostered Pitbulls, mutts and
                    designer breeds she thinks &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; due to their conflicting health and
                    behavior qualities &mdash;
                    like &ldquo;mastodor&rdquo; named Mabel, whose family surrendered her to the shelter after refusing
                    to bring her into their RV on a camping trip.</p>

                        Casey gives treats to Bronson and Eleanor on Oct. 5, 2024, in her backyard in Bloomington. The
                        animal shelter nicknamed Casey "the treat fairy."
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Before welcoming Morty, she fostered two other Carolina dogs from the seizure: Eleven and Kaia.
                    Eleven&rsquo;s adoptive parents Karen and Mike Kelley, call Green the &ldquo;kibble fairy,&rdquo;
                    because she hand-feeds all her animals.</p>

                <p>The Bloomington Animal Shelter brought Morty to Green&rsquo;s house in December 2023. Usually, Green
                    would pick the animal up at the shelter, but she didn&rsquo;t have a car at the time and Morty was
                    too large for her to transport by herself. When Morty got there, he was covered in feces (a
                    &ldquo;panic poop,&rdquo; as Green described it). It was obvious he was scared. That was nothing new
                    for her.</p>
                <p>She sat on her kitchen floor with Morty, as he avoided her gaze and tried to push himself against the
                    walls of her kitchen. He didn&rsquo;t know Green and likely didn&rsquo;t know why he was in this
                    unknown house. The presence of another animal, a curious hound-mix named Eleanor, who was separated
                    from him by a baby gate, probably wasn&rsquo;t clearing up the situation.</p>
                <p>It took a few days after this first introduction, but he eventually started to explore his new home.
                    He sniffed the kitchen floor thoroughly and started to look through a glass panel on the kitchen
                    door that led to Green&rsquo;s backyard. Slowly, he started to venture out more &mdash; into the
                    living room, into Green&rsquo;s bedroom. Eventually, the baby gate blocking him from Eleanor came
                    down.</p>
                <p>A few weeks later, Morty decided to try something he&rsquo;d seen Eleanor doing: playing with a toy.
                    While Green was at work, he experimented with a dinosaur squeaky toy. He wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure
                    what to do as he approached the toy lying on the kitchen floor. He picked it up and started swinging
                    his head, before accidentally letting go and launching the toy into the kitchen sink and hitting
                    some dishes &mdash; a fun surprise for Green when she got home that night.</p>
                <p>His confidence grew even more when he met one of his first friends: a Pitbull named Bronson. Green
                    was watching Bronson, one of her former fosters, for a few weeks when the two first met, as Bronson
                    pummeled into the kitchen and took a &ldquo;play bow&rdquo; stance. Unsure of what to do, Morty
                    imitated him, awkwardly trying out the stance himself. Luckily, Bronson didn&rsquo;t care about
                    Morty&rsquo;s hesitancy and started playing with him anyways.</p>
                <p>Bronson was the one who got Morty to go outside for the first time in May 2024. Bronson was playing
                    with Eleanor and Morty, and he ran outside into the backyard. Swept up in Bronson&rsquo;s energy,
                    Morty followed, stepping outside into the backyard full of scattered tennis balls, water guns and
                    lawn chairs.</p>
                <p>While he&rsquo;s started to feel more confident going outside in the months since, sometimes he still
                    needs an extra push. And one day in October, Green and four other canine companions &mdash; Bronson,
                    Penelope, Sierra and Eleanor &mdash; were giving him that push.</p>
                <p>Morty was presented with a new challenge: go outside with five people (three of whom were strangers)
                    to play with his closest friends. At first, Morty considered it too much to overcome &mdash; he
                    would just stay in the kitchen. But as he looked out through a window at the game of fetch going on
                    outside, he decided to give it a shot.</p>

                    Morty stands in the doorway of his foster mom's house, watching as his dog friends run around the
                    backyard Oct. 5, 2024, in Bloomington. Morty never came outside to play with his dog friends.

            <div class="story">
                <p>First, in his usual manner, he started with a quick look outside the door to assess the situation. It
                    seemed like the other dogs didn&rsquo;t mind the new people, but he couldn&rsquo;t be too sure.
                    He&rsquo;d watch for a little while longer.</p>
                <p>The dogs ran back and forth from the kitchen to backyard, as if begging him to come outside. Then,
                    Morty, suddenly caught up in the energy, ran outside, jumping over Green&rsquo;s welcome mat reading
                    &ldquo;Wipe Your Paws.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Morty seemed just as shocked as Green that he was outside. Morty looked at her, then the strangers,
                    then the dogs around him. He paced back and forth on the concrete porch, trying to decide his next
                    move.</p>
                <p>In the end, he didn&rsquo;t join the dogs in their game of keep away in the yard or approach the
                    strangers for the kibble treats they held in their hands. Instead, he chose to sit in the doorway,
                    watching.</p>
                <p class='section-break'>•••</p>


                <p>Green&rsquo;s only ever failed at saying goodbye to a foster once: when she adopted Eleanor, her
                    &ldquo;foster failure.&rdquo; Still, Morty is her longest-term foster ever. When she took him in
                    December 2023, she thought she would foster him for a month. Then, she extended the foster by two
                    months. Eventually, both Green and the shelter stopped assuming she would bring him back.</p>

                    Casey gives Elenor a kiss Sept. 12, 2024, in her home in Bloomington. Elenor was three weeks old
                    when she first came to Casey's home. Casey fostered Elenor's littermates and her mom for two weeks.

                    can&rsquo;t provide stability. I can&rsquo;t guarantee the stability long term right now,&rdquo; she
                    said, noting she might move for work or adopt a &ldquo;van life&rdquo; in the future.</p>

                <p>Morty&rsquo;s last potential adopter called in March.</p>
                <p>Everyone who knows the Carolina dog has said he&rsquo;s come a long way since his rescue &mdash; much
                    of this progress due to his time with Green.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;That foster mom taught him that being a dog can be a lot of fun,&rdquo; the Bloomington Animal
                    Shelter wrote on his adoptable pet profile page. &ldquo;She showed him how to have best dog friends,
                    how to get pets, how to be potty trained and how to love.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Green thinks each day Morty will grow braver and experience more of the world he didn&rsquo;t see on
                    North Adams Street. So much has already changed since he left the seizure. He rings a bell to go
                    outside. He loves getting treats, specifically zucchini, frozen berries and pumpkin. Each night, he
                    sits on the couch and snuggles with Green and Eleanor.</p>
                <p>He still has a way to go; Green and the shelter know that. But they hope that one day, someone will
                    give him a chance. That someone will look at him and think he&rsquo;s just a &ldquo;normal
                    dog.&rdquo;</p>
