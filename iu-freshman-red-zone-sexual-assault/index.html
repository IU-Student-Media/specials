                <p class="dropcap">
                    The freshmen women on floor seven of Harper Hall in Foster Quad learned a lot before they sat
                    through their first college lecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They learned that a knot forms in their stomach after move-in day. When their parents finish hauling
                    everything into their dorm room and then say goodbye and shut the door, they will probably cry. They
                    learned what it was like to have a panic attack on the first night. They learned ways to fight the
                    loneliness — to keep their door open, to be friendly and to search Snapchat to find other freshmen
                    to hang out with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the blur of Welcome Week, the women of floor seven spoke in the lounge past midnight and
                    found out which of them smoked weed, who drank, what their summer flings had been like and who their
                    favorite Kardashian was. They went to their first house parties and learned the power of the right
                    song, at the right moment, with the right group of new friends. When Baby Keem and Kendrick Lamar’s
                    “Family Ties” played, they discovered they could actually feel at home at IU, even if it was only
                    for four minutes and 12 seconds.

                            Two women returned home to Foster Harper's seventh floor after a night out in early August.
                            Ilana Felix recalls hearing their cries for help as they staggered down the dorm's hallway.
                            One of the women confided in Ilana that she had just been sexually assaulted in Briscoe
                            Quad. The woman never reported her assault to the university or the IUPD.

                <p>
                    Ilana Felix was sitting in her room when she heard two of her floor mates stumbling down the
                    hallway. The sound of their shoes dragging across the floor as they hobbled door to door looking for
                    help. When they came to Ilana’s open door and saw her sitting on the bed, they beelined toward her
                    with tear-streaked faces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ilana!” she recalls they said, collapsing into her lap. “You won’t believe what happened.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two of them had returned from a party at Briscoe Quad. Between dry heaves and sobs, one of the
                    women explained to Ilana how she got drunk. When one of the friends stepped away to find her Crimson
                    Card, another freshman tried to make a move on her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Come back with me,” she recalled him saying. “Let’s go to my room.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She didn’t want to go, but he wouldn’t listen. He tried to feel her up. She said she was assaulted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ilana listened to her floormate speak and the room went still. The sexual assault had already
                    happened. She couldn’t change that. She rubbed their backs and tried to think of something to say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You’re safe now,” Ilana recalls telling them, hoping they believed her. “You can take a shower if
                    you want. It’s over.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it wasn't over. It was only August.
                </p>
                <p>

                    In those very first days, before classes started, Ilana had to learn how to comfort a person going
                    through a life-altering trauma — a lesson freshmen women were already learning.

                    The first few months of freshman year are notoriously challenging. A cloud of expectations hang
                    overhead: It’s the best four years, former graduates say, and it has to be so fun, so exciting, so
                    perfect. But it's messy, confusing and overwhelming. It feels like a beginning and an ending
                    simultaneously. It feels like getting lost and being found, over and over again.

                    But amid self-discovery, freshmen students also discover the risk of sexual violence on campus.
                    According to the <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence" target="_blank">
                        Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network,</a> over 50% of sexual assaults taking place on college
                    campuses occur from a period stretching from August to Thanksgiving Break — a period known as the
                    "Red Zone."

                    The Indiana Daily Student followed four freshman women on floor seven of Foster Harper for three
                    months as they navigated college, partying and the Red Zone for the first time. That floor cushioned
                    their fall into the Red Zone with strength in numbers.

                    Aislinn Ahearn said about her and her roommate Gaby Kovac.

                    of fear of not being listened to.

                <p class="dropcap"> On the cinder block wall of Kylie Furlong’s room, there's a print of a fox and a cat
                    having a conversation. The fox tells the cat: “I want my life to be full of Great Moments.” The cat
                    responds: “Great moments exist inside of ordinary moments. Try having a cup of tea!”
                </p>
                <p>

                    The poster is Kylie’s manifesto. To her, college is about chasing great moments.

                </p>
                <p>

                    The gift of independence, specific to the freshman year of college, is a coveted experience. It’s
                    written in book after book, and in countless films and television shows. Kylie eagerly unwrapped her
                    newfound autonomy, but quickly learned it was far more nuanced than she imagined.

                </p>
                <p>

                    During Welcome Week, Kylie sauntered through the hallways, lending awkward greetings to her future
                    floor mates. Though it was awkward, these people were going to be part of the great moments — she
                    could already feel it. There was space to be filled even after the walls were decorated and the
                    furniture was placed in her room, C726. What Kylie wanted, what she needed, was people.

                    transpired, Kylie wanted to tell herself that everything will work out.

                    The gradual communication in the early days of Welcome Week quickly transpired to friendship, even
                    embarking on missions together.

                </p>

                <p>

                    She laughs as she remembers the events of the first week, scrolling through her vault of memories
                    documented on Snapchat. Kylie pauses with a smile and a laugh; she found a good one. One night, her
                    floor walked together to McGee Hall, another area of Foster. A girl had stolen their friend’s
                    blanket, and they went together to confront her.

                <p>

                    “My friends helped me, we had our own salon, but I really like it,” she jokes, rolling her eyes and
                    pointing to her hair. “It’s so college of me.”

                    For many freshman, experiencing college isn’t enough. They need to be consumed by the experience,
                    infusing themselves into the school spirit and the memories that come with it.

                <p>

                    The Great Moments stockpiled as the floor grew closer. One weekend, Kylie brought a pink polka dot
                    umbrella to a party since there was a chance of rain on the day's forecast. When it down poured,
                    everyone swarmed her at the party. Eventually, the DJ took her umbrella, telling her “we need this.”

                    But, Kylie can’t always make every “umbrella dance circle,” especially when she has early morning
                    dance rehearsal at 9 a.m.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Kylie is a dance major. It’s her passion, lifeblood, and she spends most of her day in the studio.
                    But, dance heightens her FOMO, or fear of missing out. She doesn't want to sacrifice one great
                    moment for another.

                </p>

                <p>

                    “I thought I solved my FOMO the minute I left high school,” she said. “It’s hard to learn that
                    everyone gets it and that I’m not the only one.”

                </p>

                <p>

                    That's the thing about college; it's hard to realize these experiences are universal. When a
                    freshman’s world is their floor – a community only a few feet in front of their front door – it’s
                    hard to imagine the greater community at large.

                    Kylie struggles with pouring herself into every new friendship – desiring that every new friendship
                    is just as important as the last. But, this isn’t realistic.

                </p>
                <p>

                    “I have a hard time with like, bonds fading,” Kylie admits. “I wish I could be friends with
                    everybody at the same time…so sometimes I think about that, and it’s overwhelming.”

                    Although Kylie finds no issue with meeting new friends, as a self-proclaimed hopeless romantic,
                    finding a meaningful romantic relationship in college has been Kylie’s biggest struggle.

                    In the corner of her room is an arranged list of blue and pink Post-It Notes. At first glance, the
                    barely legible pencil marks seem unimportant, but it’s a culmination of Kylie’s romantic life. Nice
                    guys go on the pink Post-It Notes. Bad guys go on the blue Post-It Notes. Several ambiguous
                    nicknames populate each of the squares, symbolic of a quintessential element of hook-up culture:
                    anonymity. All is kept in order with the oddly reverent cement-wall shrine of a pack of $1.89
                    Post-It Notes.

                        Like their neighbor, Kylie, Gaby and Aislinn also have a wall of Polaroid pictures. Gaby was
                        afraid going into this year that she wasn't going to make any friends on her floor.

                    Navigating hook-up culture means braving failed “talking" stages, “situationships” and one-night
                    stands. This shift in thought signals a major change Kylie has experienced over her first semester
                    of college. As Post-It's rearrange, so do Kylie’s relationships – fizzling and faltering.

                    hook up, or they just don’t like me.”

                <p>

                    Kylie now asks herself are these “prospects” kind? Are they good communicators? But when she settles
                    for less, tempted by loneliness, she’s left defeated — knowing she deserves more. With new
                    beginnings in unknown places, a question hangs in the air: “Will I meet the one?” But in a sea of
                    excitement of new relationships, eager connections can easily lead to unwanted advances.

                    The issue of sexual assault on college campuses has become increasingly prevalent each year,
                    especially at IU. Armstrong had just come from a workshop the morning the IDS spoke to her. The
                    training focused on sexual assault and the prevalence of victimization based on a sample of two
                    million students nationwide. Despite her experience with the women of MU, she said the reality still
                    floored her.

                    The book’s stories also reflect IU’s stories. A similar collection of unwanted advances heard now at
                    IU are seen in its pages. Below is an anecdote by one of the freshmen Hamilton and Armstrong
                    shadowed during the study, one of the many girls they followed to research what different freshman
                    experience based on their respective experiences.

                    Armstrong believes the goal of sociology is to provide people a window about what people think are
                    “individual experiences" but are often not. Sexual assault and unwanted advances lie on the other
                    side of that window, displaying the unreported reality that many women face on not just IU’s campus
                    but nationwide.

                    By mid-September, six sexual assaults had been reported to the IU Police Department. As of late
                    October, the number had climbed to 14.

                    Gaby and Aislinn were dancing in a dimly lit basement at a pledge class party . The song “Come Get
                    Her” by Rae Sremmurd blared over the speakers. Gaby was dancing alone when a guy's hand found his
                    way to her waist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He’s not touching me,” she remembers thinking. “It’s okay.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon after, both of his hands grabbed her waist and he pressed himself against her. Panic shot
                    through her body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Get off me bro,” Gaby yelled, shoving him back with her elbows. He grabbed her again, ignoring her
                    clear lack of consent.
                </p>
                <p>

                    “What the fuck,” Gaby thought.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Her hands became clammy, and her eyes desperately searched the hazy room. She locked eyes with
                    Aislinn — her rescuer. They stood across the room from each other, holding a look. Aislinn ran to
                    Gaby and grabbed her arm to yank her away from his clutch. The guy eventually was kicked out.

                <p class="dropcap">When sophomore Carolyn Saban thinks of her freshman year, she is reminded of watching
                    Gilmore Girls for the first time with her roommate, who was on her eighth watch through and
                    listening to Olivia O’Brien religiously.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carolyn has known Kylie since they were kids and they have a similar sense of style and music
                    taste. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carolyn gave Kylie an early introduction to Bloomington life – offering advice like the pad thai at
                    Siam House is amazing, Soma has the best lattes and although it’s tempting to sleep in, don’t sleep
                    your whole day away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even with the best guidance, it’s impossible to prepare a freshman for everything. Carolyn and Kylie
                    sit on opposite ends of the “Red Zone.” Although Carolyn is on the other side of the Red Zone, it
                    still affects everyone. Carolyn said there is an unsaid code amongst women, especially in situations
                    where there is higher risk for assault.

                <p>
                    “With my friends last year, we didn’t really sit down and have a conversation about it. But it was
                    known between us,” she said. "If you’re at a party, no one is left alone. If someone has to go to
                    the bathroom, you go with them. I don’t care how much you love the song, there will be other great
                    songs.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    During a party early in her freshman year in the middle of the dance floor, a girl who was alone
                    with a guy kept staring at Carolyn. She remembers how uncomfortable the girl looked, so she went
                    over and loudly exclaimed, “Hey! How have you been?” She had never met the girl in her life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “When you’re in the setting of boys and girls, and everything in between,” Kylie said. “There are no
                    parents, and you’re an adult, but still a kid…it makes it important to remember your value, and
                    don’t dumb it down for anybody.’”

                <p class="dropcap">
                    During freshman year of college, it’s possible to become someone’s best friend just as fast as their
                    enemy. It’s fluid, confusing, fun, emotional, and one of the worst and best times. There is immense
                    emotional and physical change, adapting to the bad and great moments alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kylie’s great moments are cutting her bangs in the bathroom sink, playing "Family Ties" and pink
                    polka dot umbrellas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Ilana, it's the late-night talks with her floor mates in the lounge. It's Camp Kelley and her a
                    capella group. But it's also the shock she felt as two women confided in her about a sexual assault.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aislinn’s physical change allowed her great moments to flourish in college: a plastic black bowl and
                    brush on her desk for hair dye. A new era ushered in for her against her mother's advice — the type
                    of independence that college promises. It was also having to rescue Gaby from being groped on the
                    dance floor that night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gaby learned about seeking great moments in life’s final moments in her favorite class SPHH-220:
                    Death and Dying. It's the death and rebirth that Gaby has experienced within herself since August.
                    Cast aside is the crying girl in her dorm room that first night. Reborn is the girl who films her
                    friends every night out, making sure to capture memories. It's also that night at the party when
                    Aislinn's rescue mission saved her from something potentially dangerous.
                </p>
                <p>

                    “People can feel really isolated,” Armstrong said. “But are having experiences that are hard for
                    other people for the same reasons.”

                    The women on floor seven felt isolated. They felt lost. They felt alone. However, they were
                    experiencing it all together — just feet apart from each other.

                    When you first walk onto Harper floor seven, there is a tapestry welcoming you onto their floor with
                    all the residents' faces on it, taken during a tailgate. This was bought and hung up by their ex-RA,
                    Ivan, who many of the residents credit with introducing them to life-long friends.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Without uttering a word, Aislinn saved Gaby at that party months ago. Without knowing it, the lounge
                    talks gave Kylie the energy she needed. Without Ilana, the two women from Welcome Week wouldn't have
                    had a shoulder to cry on.

                </p>

                <p>

                    This fall, 15,922 students started their freshman year at IU. Somehow in this number, the girls of
                    floor seven won the lottery.

                </p>
                <p>

                    “It’s helpful to have a support system,” Kylie says. “I know other people are struggling way more in
                    this big change. I’ve trained my mind set to find good in the changes.”

                </p>

                <p>

                    It’s also important to be the good.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Kylie recalls an experience, when she and her friends found a drunk girl walking alone back to
                    Foster. The girl was visiting a friend, and she didn’t go to IU.

                </p>

                <p>

                    “I didn’t even know this girl,” Kylie said. “But we had something in common, and I talked to her the
                    whole walk back.”

                </p>
                <p>

                    Though the "Red Zone" technically has an end date, it isn't that simple.

                </p>

                <p>

                    “It’s always there,” Kylie said. “If anything, you are still in those environments that have that
                    risk. You just have more awareness. It’s important to be aware.”

                </p>

                <p>

                    It’s not about living in fear, Kylie said, but being aware of the risk. That’s the hardest part to
                    accept. That it is simply a part of the college experience, and you must be prepared.

                </p>

                <p>

                    On Kylie’s wall, she has a sticker with “It’s on us to believe survivors” from IU’s “It’s On Us”
                    campaign. Opposite to it, a black and white photograph of someone holding a “My Body, My Choice”
                    poster hangs on the wall.

                </p>

                <p>

                    “It’s one of my values,” she said. “I don’t think anyone should have control over anyone else’s
                    body. It’s something I try to keep in mind in environments where the boys disregard that.”
