                <p class="small-description">ITTs are a four-lap event, but are completed individually. Four riders
                    compete at the same
                    time, starting in each corner of the track, to complete four laps first.</p>
                <p class="small-description">174 riders competed in the 2024 MITTs. Sigma Alpha Epsilon junior Luke Naas
                    defeated sophomore Judah
                    Thompson by .14 seconds, winning the event.</p>
