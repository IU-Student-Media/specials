Do we want that little stats section I have right now for each game? If so what stats should we display?
Scoreboard colors: Do we like green and yellow for all of them, should they be the opposite teams colors instead, or more IU themed colors?
The two photos with the confetti have duplicate captions
I would appreciate fact check on date and location for the games. For one of them the captions for the same game had two different dates one day apart so I went with what I found online for that game.
Should I put the author bios at the bottom of the page for me and designer (and Jimmy, Lauren, Sophia, and Briana)?
