                    On the morning of Wednesday, May 31, 2000, Marilyn Behrman saw her daughter Jill for the last time.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Jill rode her red and white Cannondale bike to work at the IU Student Recreational Sports Center
                    and planned on having dinner with her grandparents and her father Eric that afternoon. Jill never
                    made it to work or dinner, and the disappearance captured Bloomington&rsquo;s attention for years to
                    come. </p>

                <p>When she didn’t come back that evening, the family quickly spread flyers across town.
                    Eric went driving with Jill’s brother, Bryan, down her usual routes, looking for any sign of her. The family called
                    hospitals and then the local jail, but with no luck. </p>

                <p>
                    By Friday, Jill&rsquo;s photo was in the newspaper and the Behrman household phone was constantly
                    ringing. The Bloomington Police Department formed search parties with community members. </p>


                <p>
                    “I never went out and searched,” Marilyn said. “I wanted to be home in case she showed up. I
                    couldn't let her come home to an empty house.”
                </p>
                <figure class="wide-right">
                    <img

                            The front page of the Indiana Daily Student edition from March 14, 2003, is pictured. Jill Behrman's
                            family ended their three-year long search following her disappearance after her remains were found
                            in Martinsville, Indiana.
                        </figcaption>
                </figure>
            
                <p>
                    Jill&rsquo;s disappearance began to receive national attention. Soon, Eric and Marilyn spoke to
                    reporters from across the Midwest and were featured on Good Morning America. America&rsquo;s Most
                    Wanted aired an episode about Jill&rsquo;s case two years later. </p>

                <p>Local investigators chased down every lead, only to come back empty-handed. </p>
                <p>“I remember one of the investigators say, &lsquo;it would be so much easier if we had a crime
                    scene,&rsquo;” Marilyn said. </p>
                <p>
                    Three years later, Jill&rsquo;s remains were found outside Martinsville, putting a tragic end to the
                    search. </p>

                <p class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>
                <p>To this day, Marilyn is still surprised by the way Bloomington rallied around her family. Local
                    organizations and church groups raised money to fund a reward for anyone who could offer
                    information, while hundreds of residents gathered to grid search across town.
                </p>
                <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after her disappearance that her friends and co-workers at the SRSC wanted to
                    organize an event to keep Jill&rsquo;s story in the public eye. The annual competitive 5K “Run for
                    the Endzone” was renamed in Jill&rsquo;s honor and has been a campus staple ever since.

                </p>
                <p>The run this year is Saturday, April 5 at 11 a.m. The route begins and ends at the SRSC and makes its
                    way through IU&rsquo;s campus. <a href="https://recsports.indiana.edu/special-events/jb5k.html"
                        target="_blank">Registration takes place through</a> race day and is $35.</p>
                <p>What started as a way to help bring Jill home, is now a celebration of her life &mdash; one that her
                    recreational hobbies would feel right at home with.
                </p>

                <p>Jill was an avid cyclist and had completed a cross-country trek to Atlantic City after her high
                    school graduation in 1999. Marilyn said she was obsessed with pushing herself to the limit and
                    joining the pace setters at the front of the pack, colloquially known as the “burners.” Marilyn said
                    it was this drive that often led Jill to ride alone. While her friends thought it would be a casual
                    bike ride, to Jill, it was a training opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>The JB5K has no clocks or timers to inspire competition, instead, it has become a celebration. The 5K
                    is a color run, where participants are covered in bright, colorful powder along the route, creating
                    rainbow like patterns on their clothes by the time they reach the finish line.

                </p>
                <p> The commemorative 5K is a proper memorial in Marilyn&rsquo;s eyes, choosing positivity and joy over
                    tragedy.

                <p>Alongside the 5K, the family created the

                        Jill Behrman Emerging Leader Scholarship</a>, which is awarded
                    to a student or students who are involved in recreational sports for at least a year and have showed
                    leadership abilities.
                </p>
                <p>“I didn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time thinking and mulling about what happened,” Marilyn said.
                    “Eventually the stories bring smiles instead of tears.”
                </p>
                <p class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>
                <p>Although most current IU undergrads weren&rsquo;t even born in 2000, Jill&rsquo;s story is
                    remembered.
                </p>
                <p>Students like Sophie Wellbaum relate to Jill. Wellbaum, like Jill, works at the SRSC and walks to
                    work. Wellbaum, a junior majoring in outdoor parks and recreation and hospitality and event
                    management from Fishers, Indiana, met several of her best friends while running the 5K during her
                    freshman year. She later joined the steering committee which oversees the 5K.
                </p>
                <p>Jill&rsquo;s story and others like it may strike fear about the endless &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo; while
                    doing something as routine as walking or biking to work. For Wellbaum, it&rsquo;s a reminder to
                    advocate for campus safety, especially for first year students.
                </p>
                <p>But instead of fear, Jill&rsquo;s impact continues to be one of optimism and celebration.
                </p>
                <p>“You can see how the run is meant to celebrate her life, and how they (Jill&rsquo;s family)
                    don&rsquo;t necessarily want remembrance on how her life ended, but how her life was conducted when
                    she was alive, which I think is amazing,” Wellbaum said. </p>

                <p>Ayanna Culmer-Gilbert, a fifth year PhD candidate in chemistry from the Bahamas and member of the
                    steering committee, stumbled into the 5K as a personal challenge, just to see if she could finish
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>Culmer-Gilbert said she believes the high energy and less competitive nature of the run helps bring
                    more people in who wouldn&rsquo;t usually think a 5K is for them. The event is so much fun, she
                    said, that many attendees don&rsquo;t know the story behind it.
                </p>
                <p>“I think knowing that the university cares enough to have done something like this for a student, I
                    think is comforting to everyone,” Culmer-Gilbert said.

                <p>Marilyn, now 73, is the Undergraduate Administrative Services Coordinator for the Media School at IU.
                    She has a poster advertising the JB5K and signage supporting IU women&rsquo;s basketball hung around
                    her office space.
                </p>

                <p>For Marilyn, and many other parents who have lost a child, time is measured in the before and after
                    their child was lost. Marilyn&rsquo;s world changed that Wednesday in May 2000, and the change
                    brought with it life lessons that won&rsquo;t be easily forgotten.
                </p>
                <p>“It taught me what&rsquo;s important,” Marilyn said. “It showed me what relationships to invest in.”
