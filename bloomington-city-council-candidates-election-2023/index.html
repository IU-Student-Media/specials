                    This May, Bloomington residents will have the opportunity to choose who they want to serve them for the next four years on the city council. The city council serves as the legislative body of the city and is composed of nine people, with six districts and three at-large seats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over a week after the filing deadline, the slate of primary candidates has been finalized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a redistricting process that put four councilmembers in the same district as another councilmember, this election has the potential to shake up who serves on the council. Councilmember Jim Sims and Susan Sandberg have decided not to run for reelection, with <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2022/06/susan-sandberg-forms-exploratory-committee-to-run-for-mayor-of-bloomington" target="blank">Sandberg</a> deciding to run for mayor instead.

                    The rest of the current councilmembers are running for reelection, including Stephen Volan, who has opted to run for an at-large seat rather than run against fellow councilmember Dave Rollo. Every district has a challenger except for IU student David Wolfe Bender in <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2023/02/bloomington-city-council-district-6-uncontested-bean-appleton-withdraws" target="blank">District 6</a> and Dave Rollo in District 4.

                            Piedmont-Smith is running for reelection to the Bloomington city council because she is committed to pursuing the Climate Action Plan, which is the city’s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, increasing transparency in city government and strengthening the local social safety net.

                            Lee is running because of the necessity of increasing affordable housing and fixing an aging infrastructure that Lee believes was not built to support the city’s construction boom. He also wants to pursue a committed response to climate change and promote fairness and equity. He said he believes that the public and governmental conversation surrounding these issues have degenerated into ideological bashing with one side trying to force "one-size-fits-all" solutions.

                            Sue Sgambelluri was elected to Council on Nov. 5, 2019, has worked at IU since 1992 and has called Bloomington home since 1994. She has served in various leadership and advisory roles in organizations including Habitat for Humanity, South Central Indiana Housing Opportunities, the Community Development Block Grants Citizens Advisory Committee and the Jack Hopkins Social Service Funding Committee.

                        <p>
                            Along with other Bloomington leaders, Sgambelluri has worked directly on economic development through projects like the Trades District, Switchyard Park and repurposing the old hospital site for affordable housing development.

                        <p>
                            Besides her service on the council, Sgambelluri works as the Director of Development for the College of Arts and Sciences at IU. Her role involves working with both individuals and organizations to secure private fundraising support for IU students, faculty and programs.

                            Kate spent most of her career with NeighborWorks America, a national nonprofit focused on creating affordable housing and helping create opportunities for people to improve their lives. There, she worked with nonprofits in 240 communities across the country to measure the impact of programs in neighborhoods they serve. This included helping measure what people were proud of, how safe they felt in their community, what needed improvement and how connected people felt to their neighbors. Before that, Kate worked for the AFL-CIO in Colorado as Communications Director and has worked on nine political campaigns in fundraising and volunteer engagement. Kate said she loves trail running, growing her own food and spending time in the sun with her Russell Terrier, Gary.

                        <p>
                            Originally from Vermont, Hopi Stosberg moved to Richmond, IN to attend Earlham College, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and later went on to earn a master's degree in teaching. She and her family moved to Bloomington in December 2013, where her background as a secondary math teacher and her kindergarten-aged daughter led her to get involved at University Elementary. There, Stosberg served in leadership positions in the Parent-Teacher Organization for seven years, including president, vice president and the Chair of Fall Campaign and Learning Festival. She has also served on various committees within Monroe County Consolidated School Corporation and has volunteered in the classroom and youth sports. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her community involvement also includes volunteering with the Interfaith Winter Homeless Shelter and leading adult justice discussions, and she currently co-chairs a group that helps local refugee families with housing, employment and education. Hopi said her volunteer experience has deepened her understanding of the homeless community, the difficulty of finding affordable housing in Bloomington, finding social and government support systems and navigating Bloomington without a car.

                            Conner Wright is an undergraduate at IU Bloomington pursuing a dual-degree in business and political science. He said he can use his experiences as a renter, a daily commuter by bicycle and foot and avid hiker and camper to help address Bloomington's biggest issues. Wright cited the city’s growing housing affordability crisis, a lack of public transportation infrastructure, a lack of cyclist and pedestrian protections and climate change as some of the city’s biggest issues.

                        <p>
                            “Bloomington is home to an amazing culture, university and parks and the city needs to do everything they can to ensure Bloomington retains those attributes and utilizes them to their full potential,” Wright said.

                            Brett Heinisch grew up in Syracuse, Indiana and moved to Bloomington for college at IU. He said his priorities include addressing crime, especially on campus, reducing drug abuse and making Bloomington a great place to live and work.

                        Rana is running for city council to promote inclusion and expansion of access to childcare and healthcare. She said she is passionate about building diverse and supportive communities, and that her advocacy has shown her how much potential the city has to strengthen community resources.

                    <p>
                        David Wolfe Bender is a third-year student at Indiana University studying economics, political science and journalism. As the Director of City Relations for IU Student Government, he frequently speaks at city council meetings. His comments have covered topics such as antisemitism, city equity, tax abatements, zoning codes and traffic issues. After he graduates next year, Bender plans to stay in Bloomington for graduate school. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bender called his campaign “future-focused” and “people-centered,” describing priorities such as affordable housing, making Kirkwood Ave. a permanent space for pedestrians by closing it to cars, promoting economic development and ensuring public safety. 
                    </p>

                        Bender said students make up nearly half of Bloomington’s population, and yet students have not been represented by an undergraduate student on the city council. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We're running to change that,” Bender said. “It's time students in our city get a voice.”

He went to Bloomington High School North and now works as the winemaker at his family's winery. He said he also teaches children’s martial arts and performs and works at The Comedy Attic.

                            He believes that youth need more social engagement, especially after the past few years. He mentioned the demolition of <a href="https://bloomingtonian.com/2019/04/20/rhinos-all-ages-club-demolished/" target="blank">Rhino’s Youth Center</a> in 2019 as an example of the lack of spaces for youth and expressed support for a new youth center. Particularly, a youth center could provide a city wide LGBTQIA+ support group, Schrodt said.

                            “As a gay man myself, I know firsthand the challenges faced by LBTQIA+ youth,” Schrodt said. “The same challenges I faced in my youth have been magnified with renewed attacks against trans kids.”

                        <p>
                            Schrodt said he believes the city must provide community-wide support, starting by providing them with a safe space.

                        <p>
                            <b>Isak Asare (D)</b> is an IU faculty member and serves as co-director for the Cybersecurity and Global Policy Program and the executive director of the IU Cybersecurity Clinic. He is also a fellow at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research. He describes his work as being at the intersection of emerging technologies and policy. He said he has advised local and national governments on the opportunities and challenges from emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. 
                        </p>
                <p>
                    Asare co-authored the first city-led AI strategy in the United States, co-authored Mexico's National AI Strategy, co-founded the UK cross-governmental community of practice on AI and worked on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development playbook on information and communications technology procurement. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Asare graduated from IU and then attended the University of Oxford and University College London. He has lived in 10 countries and speaks 5 languages.
                </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Why he’s running:</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Asare is running because he loves Bloomington. He said Bloomington has been consistently ranked as one of the best cities in Indiana, a top college town and has been recognized for climate action and having a good environment for startups and businesses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “But I think we can do better, and I want to be a part of the solution,” Asare said. “I want to help make Bloomington more livable, safe and resilient.”
