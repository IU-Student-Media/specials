Save each project in its own folder with an index.html file to show up at http://specials.idsnews.com/project-name

This repository is synced every 15 minutes with the live production servers.

Files that do work:
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS


Files that **do not** work:
* Server-side programming languages - e.g. PHP, Ruby, Python. (This is a security measure)
* **Video Files** - All videos need to be hosted on a streaming site, such as YouTube, Vimeo or in your Gryphon Instance.

A few tips:
* Photos should be optimized for the web. Make sure they are RGB and aren't too big. Usually the longest side of the photo should be no more than 1,000 pixels. Ideally, you want to size the images for the size they are being displayed so your project will load as quickly as possible. You can also upload your images to Gryphon to reduce the size of your project.

**The max size limit for your entire repository that SNworks will sync is 100 MB.**

_(SNworks reserves the right to take down projects that are too large and cause stress on the web servers.)_
