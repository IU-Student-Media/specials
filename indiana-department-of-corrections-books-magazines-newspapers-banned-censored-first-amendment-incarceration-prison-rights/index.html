                    <p>
                        When Shaka Shakur was transferred from an Indiana Department of Corrections prison to one in
                        Virginia in 2018, the law books he used to help himself and other prisoners work on their
                        appeals should have been in his cell waiting for him.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They weren't.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Shakur is a co-founder of the New Afrikan Liberation Collective, a group mainly comprised of
                        Indiana
                        prisoners who seek Black liberation. He has ongoing litigation in Indiana, and for him and
                        prisoners
                        like him, being transferred away without his home state’s law books can make it difficult or
                        impossible to meet legal deadlines and continue working on your own case.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shakur, 55, was convicted of attempted murder of a Gary, Indiana, police officer in 2004, which
                        he <a href="https://www.newafrikanliberation.org/shaka-shakur/many-are-called">says</a> is a
                        wrongful conviction. After spending nearly 20 years of his 63-year sentence in
                        Indiana, he was transferred to Virginia under an agreement between state prison systems that
                        allows them to send their prisoners to other states.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shakur described the move as domestic exile, and he said he was transferred as a punishment for
                        his political activities inside the prison. In an email, IDOC Chief Communications Officer Annie
                        Goeller said Shakur was transferred after stabbing an IDOC staff member.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He said he’s spent a lot of time in segregation — or solitary confinement — and a lot of time
                        reading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Books play an important role in his life on the inside, providing him information about the
                        outside world and connecting him to other incarcerated people via study groups he’s been a part
                        of at multiple facilities. But in Indiana and in Virginia prisons alike, Shakur said he’s had
                        trouble getting and keeping books.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In February, he was re-reading “Wretched of the Earth” by Frantz Fanon. This book, and most of
                        the books he reads, are about decolonization, patriarchy, abolition and Black history, topics
                        geared toward educating and politicizing himself and other prisoners.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And topics which he and others said are sometimes classified as security threats and difficult
                        to get past the mailroom.

                    </p>
                    <p>“They were denying us history books on Malcolm X and George Jackson, but you go to the library
                        and you’ve got a ton of material in the library on Nazism,” Shakur said of his time in Indiana
                        prisons.
                    </p>
                    <div class="pull-quote-center">
                        <p class="quote">“They were denying us history books on Malcolm X and George Jackson, but you go

                    <p>
                        Experiences like Shakur’s aren’t uncommon. A 2019 report by PEN America, a freedom of expression
                        advocacy group, <a
                            href="https://pen.org/literature-locked-up-prison-book-bans-report/">concluded</a> that
                        publication censorship in prisons is the largest book ban and one
                        of the largest First Amendment violations in the U.S. today.

                        Like in other states, mailroom staff in IDOC facilities decide what publications to reject based
                        on their discretion. They are encouraged to err on the side of caution if they are unsure what
                        to do, according to mailroom training materials IDOC provided to the Indiana Daily Student.
                        Rules can change without public notice and vary between facilities.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chief Communications Officer Annie Goeller declined to be interviewed for this story without
                        previewing a list of questions, which the IDS does not allow as a condition of interviews. The
                        IDS provided some allegations in writing for Goeller to comment on. Comments attributed to IDOC
                        rather than to Goeller came from the agency’s public records email.

                    </p>
                    <p>In an email, IDOC said mailroom staff make rejection decisions based on their training, and if
                        they are unsure, they consult investigation and intelligence agents, who either make a decision
                        or refer the material to the IDOC legal division. IDOC said this chain of command ensures
                        consistent decisions across facilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Prison book bans fall into two broad categories: content-based and content-neutral.
                    </p>
                    <p>Content-neutral bans are based on the physical characteristics of the material. For example, IDOC
                        facilities reject used books if they have damage such as stains or markings.
                    </p>
                    <p>Content-based bans prohibit material that prison officials believe could disrupt the security or
                        order of the prison.

                            another request for rejection notices, IDOC said no such list exists and that all rejection

                            ​​The 2019 PEN America report found that prisons disproportionately ban books about Black
                            history and civil rights on the grounds that they may disrupt order in the prison or incite
                            racial hatred. Anecdotally, that pattern persists in Indiana.

                            Adam Scouten is an organizer for IDOC Watch, a prison abolitionist organization that works
                            with political prisoners and prisoners who become politicized while incarcerated. He said
                            IDOC frequently rejects pro-Black and Afrocentric literature on the grounds that it presents
                            a security threat or could incite racial hatred. If a publication mentions a group that IDOC
                            has designated as a Security Threat Group, that publication will be rejected, he said.

                            He listed “Stand Up, Struggle Forward” by Sanyika Shakur and the San Francisco Bay View
                            National Black Newspaper as publications he knew of that had been recently rejected at IDOC
                            facilities.

                            Nube Brown is the editor of the San Francisco Bay View, which publishes stories about San
                            Francisco’s Black community and writings by prisoners all over the U.S. She said the paper
                            is sometimes rejected at Indiana prisons and when she receives rejection letters, they often
                            argue the publication poses a security threat and contains language that could cause riots.

                            “They don't want our publication because it's educational. It's inspiring. It brings hope,”
                            Brown said. “If the prisoners are educated about who they are, what is happening, then may
                            be able to get together and resist what's taking place. That, of course, is a threat to the

                        <p> Andy Chan is a long-time volunteer and current president of Books to Prisoners, a nonprofit
                            that sends books to prisoners across the U.S. He said one common content-based rejection of
                            books that Books to Prisoners encounters is for racial content — particularly for books
                            about Black history and civil rights.

                        <p> Without a list of prohibited titles or a log of rejection notices including titles, it’s
                            impossible to say precisely whether and to what extent IDOC disproportionately rejects books
                            by and about Black people, or if there’s variation between facilities.

                            In an email, Goeller said IDOC does not reject publications by and about Black people. She
                            said the Black Panther Party is classified as a Security Threat Group because the FBI lists
                            it as an extremist organization.

                        <p>Rules for sending books to people incarcerated in IDOC facilities have fluctuated in recent
                            years. In 2018, five IDOC facilities began to only allow books from two vendors, Amazon and
                            Edward Hamilton, and rejected all used books. In mailroom training materials, IDOC said this
                            decision by those five facilities was not approved by the central office.
                        </p>
                        <p>In November 2020, a nonprofit group called the Human Rights Defense Center sued IDOC for
                            rejecting its publications. Dan Marshall, general counsel at HRDC, said IDOC is supposed to
                            notify publishers if their materials are rejected. But Marshall said HRDC only found out
                            when their subscribers notified them.

                <p>In January 2021, a court issued a preliminary injunction ordering IDOC to stop rejecting
                    books on the basis of their supplier. The injunction also required IDOC to send written
                    notice to the sender of withheld publications including a specific explanation of what part
                    of the material threatened a “specific legitimate penological interest” and a citation of
                    which policy is being violated. IDOC has to provide explicit justifications for withholding
                    or censoring publications.

                        include a reason but acknowledged the policy requires IDOC to do so. The IDS was not able to

                            This rejection letter was sent to Books to Prisoners on March 24, 2021. Despite being sent
                            after the preliminary injunction requiring IDOC to provide specific threats to penological
                            interests for rejection decisions, this letter does not do so.

                    <p>In November 2021, IDOC settled with the Human Rights Defense Center. In addition to
                        reinforcing the preliminary injunction, IDOC agreed to pay damages and to implement new
                        policies and a training program by the end of January 2022. Marshall said he hopes the
                        settlement will improve consistency and access.
                    </p>
                    <p>In response to a records request for rejection notices, IDOC said in an email, “The forms you
                        are requesting are given to each individual offender and a copy is placed in their packet.
                        The staff does not keep a collective database or log of all correspondence that is
                        confiscated.”

                    <p>
                        The settlement requires IDOC to maintain logs documenting mail confiscations.

                        For incarcerated people, books and other publications are a source of education,
                        empowerment, entertainment and connection to the outside world. Prison libraries are limited
                        and incarcerated people must be accompanied by a guard to visit the library. Tablets powered

                        Prisons have the right to ban material that threatens prison security, but those
                        restrictions are sometimes used to reject material that prisoners have a right to access.

                            Dan Marshall, general counsel at HRDC, said just because prison book restrictions often
                            violate the First Amendment doesn’t mean restrictions that violate incarcerated people’s
                            rights don’t happen.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “As our dozens and dozens of lawsuits attest, prisons and jails don’t always like to follow
                            the Constitution in that regard,” Marshall said. “Indiana’s not the only place where we’ve
                            had problems with our magazine and our books.”
                        </p>
                        <p>Prisons are supposed to notify senders when their mail is rejected. But like Marshall, Brown
                            of the San Francisco Bay View and Chan of Books to Prisoners said they sometimes find out
                            that their mail has been rejected when the incarcerated person tells them, without
                            communication from IDOC. Organizations that send materials to prisoners often don’t have the
                            bandwidth to keep track of whether their materials are getting in or to appeal the
                            mailroom’s decision, even when they’re technically allowed to do so.

                                Shaka Shakur, 55, sits in Buckingham Correctional Center in Virginia in 2021. When he
                                was transferred to Virginia in 2018, some of his books went missing.

                        <p>
                            When he first went behind bars at 16, older prisoners mentored him. They taught him about
                            Malcolm X, Fannie Lou Hamer, the prison movement in the American south. As he learned, he
                            would go out into the yard, sharing what he learned with others.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These conversations evolved into study and struggle groups. Sometimes as many as 20
                            prisoners would be studying instead of playing basketball, Shakur said.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their group created tests and assigned book reports. They would sit and talk about current
                            events, how to create their own re-entry programs or political topics like liberation and
                            socialism.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shakur said he was recently forced to send home over 90 of his personal books, which he
                            shared with other prisoners. Most of them were legal and medical texts. He had exceeded his
                            15-book limit, so the rest were considered contraband.

                        </p>
                        <p>He said rebuilding the current study group’s infrastructure will be frustrating and
                            expensive. But he’ll reorder more books, and he’ll share them with others.
                        </p>
                        <p> “In prison, knowledge is power,” Shakur said. “It’s a threat to the establishment.”
