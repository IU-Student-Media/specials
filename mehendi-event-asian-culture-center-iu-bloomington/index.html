          Students crowded inside the
          <a href="https://asianresource.indiana.edu/">Asian Culture Center</a>
          on Tuesday evening to attend a mehendi workshop. Mehendi, also known
          as henna, is a form of body art
          <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-henna-plant-transcending-time-religion-and-culture.html">originating
            from India and South Asia</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mehendi involves applying henna paste to create temporary tattoos.
          It is traditionally done as a pre-wedding celebration, especially to
          identify the bride. This was the ACC’s first henna workshop of the
          semester, which allowed students to come and learn basic techniques,
          but the center has hosted the workshop for a few years.

          The ACC purchased a new box of henna cones for the event. Students
          shared cones and practiced on one another. Some checked Pinterest
          for inspiration while others drew various floral designs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The workshop volunteer was IU freshman Utsavi Gilder. Gilder told
          the ACC during new student orientation that she did henna, and it
          asked her to help at some of its events. She did henna at
          CultureFest in August as well as the ACC’s open house.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gilder began the event by demonstrating how to hold the cone and a
          basic flower design with lines and dots.

          &ldquo;I was like, it'd be cool to give it a try and work with
          student life and also fulfill ACC's mission of promoting more
          awareness of Asian American Pacific Islander issues and histories
          around campus,&rdquo; You said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ACC also has programs like cooking demonstrations, calligraphy

          &ldquo;Our center hosting this specific kind of workshop to foster
          more interaction and engagement among our community, we think it
          would be a good way to just kind of detach them from their phones
          and learn about and enjoy new cultural experiences,&rdquo; You said.
          &ldquo;I think overall, these culture activities such as henna can
          be a fun way to introduce students to different traditions and
          cultures.&rdquo;

          their organization’s vice president of diversity, equity and
          inclusion, freshman Sofia Scott. Scott said she has always been
          passionate about DEI and became interested in the position when she
          joined the fraternity.

        <p>
          &ldquo;I've been looking into all the culture houses for different
          opportunities for the brotherhood, and then I saw henna at the
          ACC,&rdquo; Scott said. &ldquo;This is something that I've always
          heard about because I have a lot of Asian friends here and back
          home. I wanted to not only learn because of myself, but to have
          people that I'm friends with that are connected to the culture be
          able to teach me.&rdquo;

          IU sophomore Jack Carmody is also a member of Delta Sigma Pi. He had
          experience with henna in elementary school and was excited by the
          opportunity to experience it again in college. Carmody got the Delta
          Sigma Pi Greek letters hennaed on his right hand.

          &ldquo;In elementary school, I had a lot of friends from India, and
          around the Indian holidays their moms would come in and give us
          really cool, intricate dots on our hands,&rdquo; Carmody said.
          &ldquo;I found out that this was happening at the Asian Culture
          Center, and I was immediately intrigued and knew I wanted to come
          and learn more about it now that I'm in college and can experience
          it once again.&rdquo;

            were encouraged to practice before committing to the design on their skin because henna can last for
            multiple weeks.

          From start to finish, the workshop was alive with students sharing
          their knowledge of henna. They were focused on their designs but
          still took time to interact with everyone else in the center.

          At the time of their February event, the ACC didn’t know when its
          next event would be, but events are regularly posted on
          <a href="https://asianresource.indiana.edu/programs-and-services/calendar.html">its website</a>.

          &ldquo;Hopefully we will do it next month and the month after and
          hopefully more people will show up,&rdquo; Gilder said.
