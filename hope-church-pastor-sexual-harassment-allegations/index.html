              <i><p>Content warning: This article includes descriptions of sexual harassment and abuse.</p></i>

              <p class="dropcap">The founding pastor of Hope Presbyterian Church was charming and charismatic, many agree on that 
much.</p>

<p>Several former members of the Bloomington church said those traits enabled Dan Herron, their pastor, to abuse his power. Some say he sexually harassed them, while others allege exploitation and intimidation. </p>

<p>Seeking justice within the church’s government, five accusers wrote a letter in 2019 to the Central Indiana Presbytery outlining allegations against Herron. None of the accusers brought the allegations to police, citing low conviction rates for sex crimes and fear of retraumatization. The Presbytery’s court system has the power to revoke Herron’s ordination and prevent him from working within the Presbyterian Church in America again, but it has no legal authority. </p>

<p>An Indiana Daily Student reporter reached out to Herron over the phone and offered to provide 
him with a list of allegations, which Herron declined.</p>

<p>In a written statement to the Indiana Daily Student after the phone call, Herron said, “With regard to the specific accusations brought against me that I am aware of, I strongly and unequivocally deny any wrongdoing attributed to my actions, words, motivations, and character.”  </p>   

                <p>To report this story, the IDS spoke to three accusers — Abigail Harris, Kara Million and her husband Chris Baker — and reviewed documents including church court files and emails. </p>
                <img src="https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ids/4e867229-3f32-4fd7-a0ad-852b0c8dbb77.sized-1000x1000.jpg?" alt="Kara Million, 31, and her husband Chris Baker, 34, pose for a photo.

                <p class="caption">Kara Million, 31, and her husband Chris Baker, 34, pose for a photo. Baker interned for pastor Dan Herron at Hope Presbyterian Church for three years. Baker and Million left the church in December 2018 at the end of Baker's internship. </p>
                <p>Million said she has met or spoken to at least 10 other people with various accusations of abuse against Herron since sending the original letter. Those accusers, mostly couples, made their allegations anonymously to the church’s government. Million and Harris, who know their identities, said the anonymous accusers did not wish to be identified to the IDS to be contacted for comment. </p>
                
                <p>Nearly two years after the investigation into Herron’s alleged abuse began, the PCA’s highest 
                court called for the CIP to restart the investigation process. </p>
                
                <p>Herron’s accusers believe the initial investigation, which closed in February 2020 and found Herron had “no strong presumption of guilt,” was intentionally mishandled to protect him.  </p>   
                
                <p>A spokesperson for the CIP said he could not comment for this story because the new investigation, which began in February, is ongoing. Every person named in this story and each member of the original investigation commission was contacted several times for comment. Most of the 14 people contacted did not respond, and most of those who did said they could not comment because of the 
                ongoing investigation.  </p>

                <p>Bob O’Bannon, who was the chair of the initial investigation, responded to “emphatically deny 
                that there was any coverup by the commission.”</p>
                
                <p>The Sunday after the IDS reached out for comment but before this story was published, a Hope member told the IDS there had been a congregation meeting earlier that day where Hope leaders made congregants aware of this story. According to that member, the Hope leadership did not confirm nor refute any of the allegations in this story at the meeting. </p>
                
                <p>The next CIP meeting is on May 14, where there will be a vote on whether there is enough evidence against Herron to move to trial. If the committee does not find sufficient evidence against him, Herron will be exonerated in the church’s government for good. </p>       

                <p>Because of his role as an elder in the CIP, Herron can vote on all investigations — even those into his actions. Women, however, are not allowed to be elders and thus cannot vote. </p>       
                
                <p>Herron resigned from Hope in January 2020 but retains his role as an elder. He is still ordained as of early May. Herron began a yearlong, paid sabbatical after resigning. </p>
                
                <p>The accusers allege leaders within the CIP enabled Herron and protected him throughout the investigation. The same leaders who voted on the initial investigation will vote on the findings of 
                the new one.</p>

She was homeschooled, where her parents taught her creationism and that women aren’t supposed to have leadership roles in churches. She went to church every Sunday and grew up feeling like she couldn't question church doctrine.</p>

                  <p>In 2015, Million came to IU to pursue her Ph.D. Her 34-year-old husband, Chris Baker, came with her.</p>

                <p>Beginning in 2016, Baker interned at Hope Presbyterian Church, which is located in the Monroe County Convention Center. He worked there for three years while he was studying to become a minister. Baker said he thought working for Herron, the founding pastor at Monroe County’s only PCA congregation, would give him necessary experience.

                <p>Herron was Baker’s boss. Million and Baker said Herron helped them move into their Bloomington apartment. They both said their first impression was that Herron was a kind, helpful, charming person. </p>

                <p>Million could see why people might be drawn to his church. </p>
                
                <p>But during their first two years at Hope, Million and Baker noticed several members of the church’s core leadership leaving. They didn’t know why. </p>
                
                <p>Million and Baker said Herron talked negatively about those who leave the church, labeling them “dissents” and “gossips.” </p>

                <p>On Feb. 1, 2018, Million posted on Facebook in support of Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse.
                
                <p>After the sentencing, Denhollander <a target="_blank" href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/rachael-denhollander-larry-nassar-forgiveness-gospel.html" class="story-link">told Christianity Today</a>, “Church is one of the least safe places to acknowledge abuse.”</p>
                
                <p>Million posted an excerpt from Denhollander’s interview and wrote that she was tired of the church blaming “‘our sexually obsessed culture’” for sexual abuse instead of perpetrators.</p>

                  <p class="tl_explainer">Million meets Herron at a coffeeshop</p>
                </div>
                <p>Soon after her post, Million said she received a text from Herron asking if she wanted to get coffee, which was unusual to her. The church’s belief system strictly regulates relationships between men and women, and Million said Herron had always reached out to her husband before contacting her. </p>

<p>Herron was her pastor and her husband’s boss. She couldn’t not respond, she thought. She recalled replying that she was happy to meet but asking why he wanted to talk. </p>

<p>Herron told Million he had seen her Facebook post — though Million said the post was private and Herron did not follow her — and that he had mentioned Denhollander in a recent sermon, Million said. She said he wanted to talk to her to make sure 
he hadn’t offended her, so they set a time to meet at Needmore Coffee Roasters. </p>

<p>Million said she walked to Needmore alone and arrived early. She said Herron was already there, seated at a table with his coffee, his laptop open and a Bible in hand. </p>

<p>“I knew I was in trouble the second I walked in,” Million said. </p>

<p>Million said Herron was immediately aggressive and eventually shouted at and insulted her, which Herron later denied. Million said Herron argued with her, saying she and Denhollander were wrong to say churches are not safe for survivors.</p> 

<p>Million said Herron told her that her support of Denhollander was because of traumatic incidents Million experienced in the past — incidents Million said she’d talked to Herron about before. Herron used Bible quotes to bolster his points. </p>  

<p>Herron said sexual abuse is rooted in pornography, Million remembers. She responded that sexual abuse is rooted in power. </p>

<p>Million said she felt ambushed and that it hadn’t been the conversation she was anticipating. She said it seemed like she was supposed to cave to what Herron said and admit her post was wrong. </p>

<p>In an 18-page letter written to the investigation commission upon learning of the allegations against him, Herron confirmed the meeting at the coffee shop occurred. In that letter, he portrayed Million as the one who was “condemning, accusing, and abusive” toward him. </p>

    — Herron's Letter
  </p>
</div>
<p>Herron’s letter confirmed he wanted to explain why he disagreed with Million’s post, that he referenced the Bible and that they talked about their histories of trauma, but he denied being aggressive or abusive.</p>

<p>Million recalled bystanders looking on but not doing anything. </p>

<p>“I could just feel myself going into shock and dissociating because I had just never seen this before in any pastor,” Million said. “I had never seen this side of him. So it was really scary. He’s a large man and I’m a tiny woman.” </p>

<p>Suddenly, Million said, Herron’s tone and body language became flirtatious and tender. Million said he seemed to realize 
his anger was making her uncomfortable. </p>

<p>She says he told her she was clearly confused and broken — and that he could help her.</p>

<p>Herron then solicited a one-on-one “mentoring” relationship with Million, she said. She said he told her he was good at mentoring women. </p>

<p>“I know that you’ve been burned by other pastors,” Million recalled Herron said, indicating to Million he’d been collecting information about her. She said she had never told him anything about her past pastors. </p>

<p>“But I’m not like the others, I want to be your pastor, Million,” he allegedly continued. “You don’t have to have an answer for me right away.” </p>

<p>Million recalled him pausing and turning away coyly. Then he turned back. </p>

<p>“Unless you do have an answer for me.”</p>

<p> Herron did not directly address this part of Million’s allegations in his letter or in communications with the IDS, but 
in his statement to the IDS he denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Million, still feeling stuck to her chair, knew she had to find a way out of the situation, but didn’t feel confident outright rejecting the offer. She said she did not respond to his suggestion of a mentorship. Instead, she told Herron she wasn’t going to agree with him regarding Denhollander, and they went their separate ways.</p>

<p>“My head was spinning,” Million said. “I was just in shock. I was trying to process what had even happened and what it meant.” </p>

          <p class="dropcap">Million said she didn’t tell anyone what happened at the coffee shop at first. Not even Baker, her husband. She felt alone. </p>

<p>“I basically had zero power and Dan had all of the power,” Million said. </p>

<p>Million temporarily shut down her Facebook account and tried to handle the intense trauma she felt by attempting to get away from it. When she brought the account back online about two months after the coffee shop conversation, she said she immediately blocked Herron and his wife.</p>
<p>Million now alleges multiple people were communicating about her to Herron without her knowledge, but at the time, she said she didn’t know that was happening. When she privately told CIP member Jeff Childress in January 2019 she was upset because one of her students died, she had an email from Herron within the day.</p>
          
          <p>“It was very isolating,” Million said. “Especially when he started escalating his behavior over time — recruiting other people to help keep tabs on me and get access to me — I didn't even know who to trust.” </p>

<p>Million calls the people who talked to Herron about her social media posts and conversations with them “flying monkeys,” 
referencing the monkeys in “The Wizard of Oz” who spied for the Wicked Witch of the West. Million alleges there were three of them: Childress, biblical counselor Craig Mercer and Hope Director of Music Rebecca Cullison. The IDS reviewed emails confirming Childress talking to Herron about Million, but not the other two. </p>

<p>In the letter, Herron briefly mentioned consulting Childress about Million before they met at Needmore, but he does not mention consulting the others.</p>

<p>Million said Herron’s inappropriate behavior toward her came at events hosted in the homes of those who were talking about her to Herron. She alleges Herron cornered her and forced her to talk to him by using his body to not allow her to walk past at multiple Hope events in 2018. In his letter, Herron wrote he did not recall ever cornering anyone, but did admit he does “tower over a lot of people” and has a “physical presence.” </p>

            <p>Million sat on the couch next to Baker, trying to prevent Herron from sitting next to her. But Herron slid in front of her to pick up books that were sitting on a coffee table. Million alleges he leaned over, reached down slowly and pressed his 
            body flush against her breasts — right in front of Baker. Baker and Million allege Herron stayed pressed against her for 10 
            to 15 seconds. </p>
            
            <p>Neither Million nor Baker did or said anything in that moment. They both watched, stunned.  </p>

But because of power imbalances inherent to churches, sexual misconduct is not limited to Catholic churches. <a href="https://www.pcusa.org/site_media/media/uploads/iarp/pdfs/iarp_final_report.pdf" target="_blank" class="story-link">A report from the Presbyterian Church (USA) in October 2020 found more than 130 reported incidents of sexual and physical abuse over the past 40 years.</a></p>

            <p>Million said her church participation severely declined while she was being harassed by Herron. She was afraid of him. </p>
            
            <p>Zoe Peterson, director of IU’s Kinsey Institute Sexual Assault Research Initiative, said sexual harassment and assaults are vastly underreported because of fear like Million’s. </p>
            
            <p>Sexual misconduct, Peterson said, can involve pervasive unwanted sexual comments, unwanted touching and unwanted flirting after the person has expressed a lack of interest.</p>
            
            <p>Peterson spoke in general about sexual misconduct and did not comment specifically on the allegations in this story. </p>
            <p>Before Herron allegedly pressed himself against Million’s chest, Million had only told Baker pieces of what had happened 
            at the coffee shop. He knew there was some sort of disagreement between Million and Herron, and she felt uncomfortable around Herron, but that was all.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout 2018, Baker alleges Herron repeatedly and more frequently asked him while at work about why Million didn’t like him and that he needed to make her like him. After Herron’s meeting with Million at the coffee shop, Baker said Herron passed over him for potential promotions. </p>
            
            <p>In his letter, Herron claimed Baker was an “incompetent” employee who failed in his duties at work. </p>
            
            <p>“It’s a very awkward position because Herron is essentially responsible for signing my paychecks, which we needed to survive,” Baker said. </p>
            
            <p>Peterson said sexual harassment can be more threatening when it comes from someone in a position of power, such as a pastor, because that person can harm the person’s career or create a negative environment. </p>
            
            <p>“It creates an environment that doesn’t feel safe and is very distracting and prevents people from doing whatever they’re supposed to do in that environment, whether it’s get an education, do their job or practice their spirituality,” Peterson said. </p>
            
            <p>At the time, Baker said he was in charge of setting up Hope events. While he was busy working on the logistics at one event in 2018, Million was left alone, which Baker believes was purposeful so Herron could interact with her. </p>

          </div>

          <p>Baker said Herron’s alleged retribution toward him, including not paying him what he was owed, began in summer 2018. Herron denied this was retribution, and denied paying Baker less than he was owed. He claimed Baker, who had to find sponsors to pay his salary, did not raise enough money. </p>

          <p>In a lawsuit against Hope filed in December 2020, Baker alleged he was not paid what he was owed for his internship from 
          September through December of 2018, according to Monroe County court documents. Baker filed a small claims lawsuit against Hope, the CIP and the Reformed University Fellowship in December 2020 for $8,000 for lost wages and fees, interest and other 
          relief. </p>
          
          <p>The case was ultimately settled outside of court, and Baker received $1,000, according to Herron’s letter. In that letter, Herron described the $1,000 as a “gift.”</p>
          
          <p>Baker said he began to look for work elsewhere throughout 2018, but he didn’t want to use Herron as a reference. </p>  
          
          <p>“Even being associated with this man is potentially affecting my job prospects,” Baker said. </p>

              <p>Baker and Million left Hope when Baker’s three-year internship ended in December 2018. They have not been a member of any church since. </p>
              
              <p>“There are three types of people: prophets, priests and kings,” Baker alleged CIP Coordinator of Church Planting Tim Kirk told Baker while meeting in early 2019 to talk about his internship. “And Dan, well, he’s a king. And well Chris, you’re not a king, and you’re not fit to work with a king like Dan in ministry.” </p>

              <p>Abigail Harris, 27, came to Bloomington from Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2017 after her partner Josh Harris was accepted into IU’s Germanic studies Ph.D. program. </p>

              <p>They, too, went to church every Sunday. They found Hope while looking for a Presbyterian church in Bloomington. </p>     
              
              <p>And like Million, Harris alleges Herron asked her to meet with him one-on-one. Like Million, Harris found this odd because Herron would normally speak with a woman’s husband before reaching out to her. </p>
              
              <p>Harris taught piano lessons for Herron’s daughter. She remembers having a positive relationship with his daughter and wife. </p>

              </div>
              <p>One day in summer 2018 after a piano lesson, Harris remembers standing out on Herron’s driveway, one step below him. Herron stood shirtless after a boxing workout, Harris says. As they talked, she recalled his eyes scanning up and down her body, checking her out in a way that made her feel uncomfortable. </p>
              
              <p>Another day in 2018, Harris alleges Herron leaned into her row during a church service and pressed his body against hers. </p>

                <p>“With regard to the worship service experience — I do not recall this, and you have my recorded testimony of this,” Herron wrote in his letter. “But, in reflecting on that possible scenario, yes, I could have approached it differently.”</p>     

                <p>Herron said in his letter he did touch congregants on the shoulder, mostly during communion. He said he would only touch 
                people he knew personally. </p>
                
                <p>Harris said she became increasingly uncomfortable around Herron over time. She tried to only teach lessons on days Herron would not be home and ultimately stopped teaching his daughter altogether in September 2019, according to emails between her and the CIP. </p>
                
                <p>Harris and Million became friends in 2019 after Million left the church. As they became closer, Harris told Million her story, thinking Million wouldn’t believe her. </p>
                
                <p>“No, I believe you, because it happened to me too,” she recalled Million saying. </p>
                
                <p>Since Million and Baker left the church, they say they’ve met Harris and at least 10 other people who have made allegations of misconduct against Herron. Those 10, Million said, were anonymous in letters to the church and did not wish to comment for this story. </p>
                
                <p>At a party in 2019, Baker met with a friend who had also left Hope. The friend told Baker that Herron had asked him which women at Hope he thought were hot, Baker said. When the friend didn’t participate, Herron allegedly began listing off the women he thought were hot. Million and Harris were among them. Herron allegedly said he liked to get into one-on-one mentoring relationships with women he’s physically attracted to. </p>
                
                <p>“Dan not only knows exactly what he was doing to me and to these other women, but he was bragging about it,” Million said. </p>
                
                <p>After hearing what Baker had learned, Harris decided it was time to write a letter to the CIP. </p>

              <p>Herron went on to define what a “hater” is, using a definition from Urban Dictionary. </p>

              </div>
              <p>In September 2019, the CIP voted to create a commission to investigate Herron. The commission was composed of elders in the CIP, all of whom knew Herron before the investigation. </p>
              
              <p>Bob O’Bannon, the senior pastor at New Life Presbyterian Church in Yorktown, Indiana, was selected to head the commission. His selection immediately raised concerns for Million and Harris, because of a tweet and retweets in which he claimed Christine Blasey Ford might have been politically motivated in her accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</p>

              <p>Million and Harris emailed Holroyd about O’Bannon’s tweets after they found out who was on the commission in October 2019. Holroyd responded that two women would be on the commission as advisers, and that would be enough to “mitigate against the intimidation [the accusers] undoubtedly will feel.” </p>

              
              <p>The commission wrote a report of its findings. Then, the elders voted on whether to deliver the findings to the CIP. </p>
              <p>Women in the PCA cannot be elders. The two women serving as advisers to the investigation commission were not allowed to 
              vote on the report.</p>
              
              <p>The CIP could have affirmed the report, issue pastoral corrections — including preventing Herron from being a senior pastor at his next job — asked for another investigation or found Herron guilty and stripped him of his ordination.</p>

              <p>Just over two weeks after Million and Harris raised concerns about his tweets, O’Bannon sent an email to Million suggesting it could be beneficial for the investigation to reveal the names of those who came forward anonymously — including potentially sharing that information with Herron — in advance of an Oct. 30, 2019, testimony in front of the commission. The accusers refused to do so. </p>
              
              <p>Million and Baker said they saw Herron multiple times while out in Bloomington during this process. They were scared to go out in public. After Herron was informed of the allegations, Holroyd told Million to call the police if she saw Herron at 
              her house. </p>
              
              <p>Herron — who was not told the identity of his accusers, according to emails — named many people he believed were testifying against him in his letter. He wrote that he believes the accusers had a large desire to harm him and that he felt “sexually objectified, harassed, and abused by this group.”</p>

              </p>
            </div>
          <p>The investigation commission's February 2020 report said its six male members voted unanimously that it found no “strong presumption of guilt” for Herron, and the accusations did not rise to the level of chargeable offenses, according to the commission’s report. 
          </p>
          <p>However, he was issued pastoral recommendations, including attending counseling, attending trainings on gender dynamics in the workplace and not transferring to other Presbyteries in a head pastor role. 
          </p>
          <p>CIP elders voted to uphold the commission’s findings.  </p>

          <p>Ebert, who couldn’t vote on the report, disagreed with the outcome.</p>

          <p>The ruling also frustrated CIP elder Steve Marusich, who works at Trinity Church in Brownsburg, Indiana. Marusich did not want to speculate on guilt but told the IDS there were clear flaws in the ruling — saying the commission ruled there wasn’t enough “presumption of guilt” to move to a full trial, but the commission was also going to issue “pastoral corrections” to Herron. </p>

          <p>“I was like, ‘Wait, it’s one or the other,’” Marusich said. “If he’s innocent, you can’t correct him. If you think he’s guilty, or you think he might be guilty and there’s enough evidence to point to that, then we need to be having a trial.” </p>

      </div>
      <p>In July, Marusich filed a complaint with the Standing Judicial Commission — in essence, the CIP’s supreme court, whose rulings are final. 
      </p>
      <p>The SJC reviewed whether the investigation commission made a mistake in its ruling of no presumption of guilt for Herron and not releasing the full report of its investigation. 
      </p>
      <p>The IDS reviewed both the original and edited reports from the investigation. The original report provided a general assessment of the commission review of Herron’s actions, which the edited version did not. The original report described pastoral recommendations for Herron, which the edited version did not. The original report was three pages, and the edited version was one. 
      </p>
      <p>The original report also claimed Herron “was placed in an awkward situation” because he didn’t know the identities of his accusers. 
      </p>
      <p>The edited report was one page and said there was not a strong presumption of guilt. It did not elaborate on a review of the allegations nor detail the pastoral recommendations issued to Herron.

              <p>Harris said she doesn’t regret sending the letter to the CIP in 2019, but she didn’t think this would consume her time in graduate school. </p>

              <p>“All of his prospects in this denomination got completely blown up behind his back,” Million said.</p>
              
              <p>Baker has applied for many pastoral jobs. He can’t get any. He believes Herron tarnished his reputation, and even being associated with Herron is why he’s working in a Jimmy John’s and not a church. </p>
              
              <p>“I don’t hate my Jimmy John’s job,” Baker said. “I’d just rather be someplace else.”</p>
              
              <p>After being taught creationism as a child, Million will receive her Ph.D. in evolutionary biology. Once she graduates in 
              May, she and Baker will leave Bloomington. Million’s dream is to study darter fish in Tennessee. </p>
              
              <p>Baker doesn’t care where they end up, but the further from Herron the better. That’s the only way Baker will get a job in ministry again, he said. </p>
              
              <p>None of the three accusers who spoke to the IDS have been to church in months, a choice they said has nothing to do with 
              the COVID-19 pandemic. At some point, when she’s far away from the CIP, Million would like to go back to church.
              
          <p>For now, she’s too scared.</p>
          <p><i>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Jeff Childress’ title. He is a CIP member.</i></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;"><i>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of one of the people Million said spoke with Herron about her. Biblical counselor Craig Mercer was the third person.</i></p>

                  <p>"I believe all women have the right to come forward and be heard.  Throughout this ordeal, I have tried whenever possible to listen thoughtfully and remain silent, confident that the truth will prevail.</p>

<p>With regard to the specific accusations brought against me that I am aware of, I strongly and unequivocally deny any wrongdoing attributed to my actions, words, motivations, and character. </p>  

<p>This is a cruel and malicious attempt by a very small group of people determined to tear apart our family, church and community by whatever means necessary. </p>

<p>I have participated fully in an exhaustive multi-month independent investigation which found no 
credible evidence of wrongdoing. </p>

<p>My family and I have been blessed with the incredible support of our community during this difficult time.  I am certain these allegations will soon be proven false."</p>

          <p><i>To report this story, the IDS spent a month talking to three accusers, a church elder and one of the women involved in the initial investigation into Herron. The IDS contacted every person against whom accusations were made. The allegations in the story were quoted and paraphrased from emails, church court documents, Monroe County court documents and interviews. </i></p>
