                                    Woodson will retire after the Hoosiers’ final game this season.

                        <p>In the transfer portal era of college basketball, coaching changes generally coincide with a
                            clean slate roster. If that&rsquo;s the case with Indiana next season, look no further than
                            Otzelberger.</p>
                        <p>After inheriting a 2-22 Cyclones team in 2021-22, Otzelberger led his team to a Sweet 16 with
                            a roster that featured only three returning scholarship players. Now in his fourth season at
                            the helm, No. 8 Iowa State holds a 19-5 record and is on pace to reach its fourth straight
                            NCAA Tournament. </p>

                        <p>There are two major concerns with Otzelberger&rsquo;s potential hire. For one, he struggled
                            in a brief two-year stint at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, tallying a 29-30 record
                            before his jump to Ames, Iowa. The other issue is whether Otzelberger would be interested in
                            leaving Iowa State.</p>
                        <p>Including his time spent as an assistant, he&rsquo;s currently in his 12th season with the
                            program. Additionally, his wife, former Cyclone women&rsquo;s basketball star Alison Lacey,

                            a 135-66 record, one NCAA Tournament appearance and &mdash; in his final year with the Mean
                            Green &mdash; a National Invitational Tournament title.</p>
                        <p>The Red Raiders hired McCasland ahead of the 2023-24 season. Amid his second campaign with
                            Texas Tech, he holds a 41-15 record at the program&rsquo;s helm. Indiana could be an ideal
                            landing spot for McCasland if he&rsquo;s willing to leave the Lone Star State he grew up in.

                            Feb. 8 reignited similar conversations to one year prior.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t crossed my mind, other than just what friends and family have said,
                            and to be honest, I&rsquo;ve eliminated all that,&rdquo; May said postgame.</p>
                        <p>In addition to May&rsquo;s time as a student manager under Bob Knight from 1996-2000, his
                            mother is a Bloomington resident. While it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s focused on his current
                            role with Michigan, there are certainly concrete factors that could influence May to return
                            to the same program he called his &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; in that same postgame press
                            conference.</p>

                        <p>Would Cronin leave Los Angeles for Bloomington? That&rsquo;s the biggest question surrounding
                            the Cincinnati native, but his Midwest ties coupled with the chance to avoid multiple
                            cross-country road trips during conference play gives the Hoosiers a strong opening pitch.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cronin, 53, has a career record of 498-230. He spent the first three years of his coaching
                            career at Murray State University before returning to his alma mater, the University of
                            Cincinnati, for 13 seasons. He&rsquo;s spent the last six years at UCLA.</p>
                        <p>If Indiana athletic director Scott Dolson wants a coach with proven Power Five success and
                            connections to the region, Cronin, who&rsquo;s made 14 NCAA Tournament appearances and
                            reached the Final Four in 2021, is a strong option. His $16 million buyout, however, may be
                            too big an obstacle to overcome.</p>

                        <p>Smart is from Wisconsin, and after a rocky six-year stretch at the University of Texas where

                        <p>Smart signed a contract extension with the Golden Eagles last year, and because Marquette is
                            a private institution, the details of Smart&rsquo;s buyout are unknown. It's also uncertain
                            whether he&rsquo;d want to leave Milwaukee &mdash; but if he does, his track record of
                            success and glimpses of deep March runs should at least warrant a call from Dolson.</p>

                            Indiana, he played four seasons at Division III DePauw University. Soon after, Stevens began
                            his coaching career as an assistant under Todd Lickliter at Butler University.</p>
                        <p>At just 30 years old, he was hired as the Bulldogs head coach before the 2007-08 season. In
                            six seasons with Stevens at the helm, Butler tallied a 166-49 overall record, made five NCAA
                            Tournament appearances and made back-to-back trips to the National Championship in 2010 and
                            2011.</p>
                        <p>His success in the college ranks earned him the job as head coach of the NBA&rsquo;s Boston
                            Celtics, a position he held from 2013-2021. His Celtics teams reached the playoffs in each
                            of their final seven seasons.

                            and the University of Louisville last offseason, getting Drew to leave Baylor won&rsquo;t be
                            an easy task. He&rsquo;s been with the program since 2003 and turned a historically poor
                            program into a fixture of the Big 12 that won the national championship in 2021.</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s true, Drew grew up in Valparaiso, Indiana, coached at Valparaiso University before
                            his time in Waco, Texas, and graduated from in-state Butler. Regardless, a $4.5 million
                            buyout along with over two decades of tenure with Baylor makes a jump to Indiana appear
                            far-fetched.</p>

                        <p>If the Hoosiers can convince a previously resistant Oats to leave Alabama, it would be an
                            expensive decision. His current contract includes an $18 million buyout. Now in his sixth
                            season with the Crimson Tide, Oats has led the program to a pair of Sweet 16 appearances and
                            a Final Four in 2024.</p>
                        <p>In 2021 &mdash; the last time Indiana entered a coaching search &mdash; Oats stated that he
                            had &ldquo;No interest&rdquo; in departing Tuscaloosa. It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine that
                            the sustained success Alabama&rsquo;s had since those comments were made has shifted his
                            mindset.</p>

                        <p>Was it merely a coincidence Beard name-dropped late Indiana head coach Bob Knight while
                            leading No. 25 Ole Miss to a 98-84 victory against No. 14 Kentucky on Tuesday?</p>
                        <p>Who knows &mdash; but Beard, who served as an associate head coach under Bob and Pat Knight
                            from 2001-11 at Texas Tech University, has an innate understanding of the Knight
                            family&rsquo;s approach. Woodson played under Knight from 1976-80, and perhaps Dolson opts
                            to leave the Knight tree.</p>
                        <p>Beard, however, isn&rsquo;t merely a Knight protege. In Division I stops at the University of
                            Arkansas at Little Rock, Texas Tech, the University of Texas and Ole Miss, Beard has amassed
                            a record of 208-91 while making the NCAA Tournament six times in his nine seasons.</p>
                        <p>There are off-court questions for Beard, who was arrested Dec. 12, 2022, on a third-degree
                            felony charge of assault against his then-fiancee, Randi Trew. The charges were ultimately
                            dropped due to the case evidence and Trew&rsquo;s wishes not to prosecute. Trew, now
                            Beard&rsquo;s ex-fiancee, later said Beard acted in self-defense.</p>

                            basketball version of a Cignetti-esque swing.</p>
                        <p>The 43-year-old McCollum went 395-91 across 15 years as the head coach at Northwest Missouri
                            State University before leveling up to Drake this year. McCollum has the Bulldogs at 21-2 in
                            his first season, but his lack of experience at the Power Four level could prove too much of
                            a jump for Dolson.</p>
