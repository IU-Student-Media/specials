        <p>At IU Cinema, the process of screening a film begins long before the audience enters the theater. With a
          34-foot screen, four projectors and 21 speakers, the art house venue is equipped to deliver a state-of-the-art
          viewing experience, but getting to that point takes careful planning and technical precision.</p>
        <p>The Indiana Daily Student spoke with IU Cinema Director Alicia Kozma to get an in-depth perspective on how a
          movie is developed at the cinema.</p>

        <h3>Projecting on digital</h3>

        <p>It starts with coordination between the cinema and the film&rsquo;s distributor. Once a film is selected, the
          cinema works directly with the distributor, who sends across a digital cinema package. The DCP is essentially
          an external hard drive containing various files &mdash; most importantly, the film itself. It may also include
          bonus content, trailers and other additional materials if requested.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We aim to receive these DCPs about six weeks in advance of the scheduled screening,&rdquo; Kozma said.
          &ldquo;Although four weeks is our minimum threshold.&rdquo;</p>
        <figure class="wide-right">

            Cinema Technology Specialist Seth Mutchler discusses an event with two student projectionists on March 25,
            2022, at the IU Cinema. Student Projectionists work under the direct supervision of the Technology Manager
            and operate as part of a team to present digital cinema screenings.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Once the DCP arrives, it is ingested and copied into the digital projector's server. The server is
          responsible for storing and managing every piece of content that appears on screen. At this stage, the
          technical team checks to ensure the files are intact and functioning correctly. To unlock and play the
          encrypted film content, the team uses a unique digital code called the key delivery message from the
          distributor.</p>
        <p>With the key in place, it&rsquo;s time to initiate quality control. This includes a thorough check of the
          entire film, ensuring it looks and sounds the way it should. The cinema employees harness the film through an
          integrated cinema media processor chip called Barco Alchemy, which reads the content from the DCP. They
          additionally verify the availability of accessibility features like captions. The cinema also makes sure its
          closed-caption devices work properly with the content.</p>
        <p>About three weeks before the screening, the film is scheduled for another round of QC and testing.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our digital projector operates much like Spotify or Apple Music,&rdquo; Kozma said. &ldquo;We maintain
          a playlist to organize everything shown on screen.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>This playlist, built using a software called Doremi, helps to control dynamic elements such as moving the
          curtains and adjusting the lights. Pre-show materials such as emergency exit slides, promotional content and
          trailers are assembled as needed. The film and any bonus material are added after the pre-show lineup.</p>

              Chainsaw Massacre” on March 6, 2025, at the IU Cinema. The old film print of the classic 1974 slasher drew
              a sold-out audience to the theater.

              Student projectionist Ebenezer Eferobor checks a film at the projectionist portal station on March 25,
              2022, at the IU Cinema. The station allows the projectionist to configure playback and volume settings and
              automations like lighting and curtain movement while overlooking the screen through a window.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>Sound testing is one of the first steps in QC. Because every film has its own unique audio levels,
          projectionists identify the quietest and loudest moments to ensure volume remains consistent.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t automated by the way,&rdquo; Kozma said. &ldquo;It's all done manually by ear.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Since the number of people in the room affects the way sound travels, the volume is adjusted closer to the
          screening day based on the audience size to create a balanced audio experience.</p>
        <p>Then the cinema conducts two rounds of testing in the weeks before the screening. On the day of the event, a
          third and final check is performed. As the film starts playing, the projectionists monitor the picture and
          sound from the booth, while other staff members listen from inside the auditorium.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If the crowd is larger than expected, small real-time adjustments to the volume might be made,&rdquo;
          Kozma said. &ldquo;These changes are subtle and go unnoticed by most, but they help create the best possible
          experience.&rdquo;</p>

        <h3>Projecting on film</h3>
        <p>When the cinema screens on film instead of digital, the process is much more hands-on. The film typically
          arrives as one to eight physical reels, depending on the runtime and are carefully inspected before
          screenings. Technicians have inspection benches with film runners at both ends. Using a magnifying loop and a
          light table, the technicians crank each reel manually, checking for shrinkage, dirt, damage and any previous
          repairs.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t proceed until we know the print is safe for both the film and the projector,&rdquo;
          Kozma said.</p>
        <figure class="lg-image">

            Cinema Technology Specialist Seth Mutchler threads a film reel onto the projector on March 25, 2022, at the
            IU Cinema. Threading involves carefully routing the 16mm film through sprockets and rollers to ensure smooth
            playback and proper sound synchronization.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>Film prints are expected at least eight weeks ahead of time because they&rsquo;re bulky, fragile and must be
          shipped with care.</p>
        <p>Film screenings also require different equipment than digital ones. While digital content can be inspected
          through software, the celluloid-based reels need to be physically reviewed frame by frame. Once inspected, the
          reels are assembled in the correct order.</p>
        <figure class="lg-image">

            Student projectionist Grayson Pettit builds a show at the projectionist operation station September 2024 at
            the IU Cinema. The building process involves arranging a playlist of the movie along with pre-show slides
            and additional content using a software called Doremi.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The cinema boasts twin Kinoton 16mm and 35mm changeover film projectors for seamless reel changes. While one
          projector runs, the subsequent reel is prepped on the other.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always one reel ahead,&rdquo; Kozma said. &ldquo;As soon as one reel ends, the next one
          begins without delay.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Sound for film works differently than digital, so the employees test it twice to get it right. Even with a
          film print, the employees can still create a digital playlist for pre-show content and automation, meaning
          both digital and analog systems work in tandem.</p>
        <p>Unlike digital screenings, which can be fine-tuned remotely &mdash; sometimes even using an iPad &mdash; film
          projectionists must be physically present in the booth to make manual corrections. For instance, if the film
          slips out of frame alignment during projection, the operator must adjust it by hand.</p>
        <figure class="lg-image">
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/d97ce1a7-4313-4514-9ca9-1c5eabda6259.original.jpg"

            Director of Cinema Technology B. Elena Grassia mounts a lens on the twin Kinoton projector on March 25,
            2022, at the IU Cinema. The Kinoton FP 38 E-S is a dual guage projector capable of projecting both 35mm and
            16mm film.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>&ldquo;These changes are often so subtle that audiences won&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo; Kozma said. &ldquo;But a
          trained eye catches them immediately.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Captions are harder to manage. Older celluloid prints lack open captions because the technology simply
          didn&rsquo;t exist when they were made. Whether closed-caption options are available depends on whether the
          film was remastered. Kozma said accessibility remains a challenge.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Even though we&rsquo;re required to provide accessible screenings, distributors are not obligated to
          supply accessible versions,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So, sometimes, even when we want to offer captions, they
          just don&rsquo;t exist for certain titles.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>For celluloid film, inspecting the reels alone takes five to seven hours, and the full preparation process
          &mdash; inspection, assembly and testing &mdash; can take anywhere from 10 to 15 hours in total.</p>
        <p>Once the screening ends, the employees rewind the reels, prepare an inspection report, detailing any issues
          or repairs, and repack the film into heavy metal containers to return to the distributor.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Preparing a film to be screened at IU Cinema &mdash; whether digitally or on celluloid &mdash; is a
          very detailed
          and specialized process,&rdquo; Kozma said. &ldquo;From the seats in the Cinema it looks like movie magic when
          it&rsquo;s really the dedicated labor and talent of the Cinema team.&rdquo;</p>
