      <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Dr. Seuss skit was always Hannah Wilson’s favorite part of sorority recruitment.
      Inside the walls of Gamma Phi Beta, colorful and loud characters act out scenes from Dr. Seuss books. Hannah looked on as recruitment chair, directing the skit, said Gamma Phi member and friend Jessie Buck.
      </p>


      <p>After one round of girls had come through the house and before another round came to experience the skit for themselves, Hannah would provide her sisters with advice, encouragement and support: this could be fixed, this was done well. She never missed a chance to congratulate a sister on a job well done.</p>
      
      <p>“Those are long days,” Buck said. “She was always the one picking up the morale for the house. She was so amazing and helpful.”</p>
     
     <p> In Gamma Phi, Wilson was the sister to always keep a positive outlook. Before she died earlier this week, Hannah was a senior majoring in psychology, and set to graduate this May.</p>

      <p>Her hope was to go into counseling, Buck said.</p>

      <p>“Her ultimate goal was to be a sex therapist,” Buck said.</p>

      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ids/57890_caps_0501webo.jpg" >

      <p>And Hannah took steps towards her goal, seeking out the advice of graduate student Jasmine Utterback. She was unsure of exactly what she wanted to do in the field of sexual health, and Jasmine suggested helping organize the event 
      Cupcakes and Condoms.</p>

      <p>Cupcakes and Condoms, which took place last week, found Hannah happy and smiling, Utterback said.</p>

      <p>“She was so happy to be helping out and to be a part of it,” she said.</p>

      <p>Just last week, Hannah and Jasmine were making plans for sexual health events Hannah could do with her sorority next year. She may have been graduating, but she still wanted to come back to help Gamma Phi, Utterback said.</p>

      <p>“There were so many opportunities that were ahead for her,” Jasmine said. “I was looking forward to staying in contact with her after graduation… . To see what she was planning to do next.”</p>

      <p>Before Hannah went to graduate school and before she became a counselor, she wanted to take a year off after graduation and work in her hometown as the junior varsity cheer coach at Fishers High School in Fishers, Ind.</p>
      
      <p>“She would have been an amazing coach,” Buck added.</p>
      
      <p>Hannah’s ability to pick up people when they’re down, to cheer for other people and have a smile for anyone who needed it isn’t cause for debate between people who knew her.</p>
      
      <p>Buck met Hannah for the first time at bid night for Gamma Phi. Her laugh, she said, took over the whole room.</p>
      
      <p>“That’s what I’ll remember most about Hannah, her ability to just light up the entire room,” Buck said. “She could cheer up everyone’s mood, no matter how bad of a day you were having.”</p>
      
      <p>Matt Molewyk, resident DJ at Kilroy’s Dunkirk and close friend of Hannah’s, said in a Facebook post that he was proud to call her one of his best friends.</p>
      
      <p>“She's the rare type of person that really makes an impact on you,” he said. “She was so loving and down to earth.”</p>
