                <p>
                    Their partner Randall gives them a quick kiss goodbye as he steps out the front door. The birds
                    start chirping and light slowly shines through the home’s front windows. Xan picks up their mug and
                    makes their way toward their office to get their medicine. It’s just about time for their weekly
                    hormone injection.

                        alt="Xan Smith inspects a syringe of testosterone to ensure there are no air bubbles.">
                    <figcaption>Xan, who is nonbinary transmasculine, doesn’t have a concrete label. The most concrete
                        label they have is trans masc nonbinary, but that’s as concrete as they’re going to get and they
                        like that. Xan says it gives them a lot of flexibility to just be who they are. They began
                        medically transitioning last November and had to learn how to inject themself. At the Student
                        Health Center, a nurse taught them how to inject, switching the needles and measuring.
                    </figcaption>

                <p>
                    From a nearby shelf, they grab a red and white striped paper bag. You can see the IU logo near its
                    center. Inside are needles and small vials of clear liquid — testosterone. Xan takes a wrapped
                    needle and one of the small vials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xan is a 31-year-old graduate student at IU. They are a Ph.D. candidate at the Media School,
                    studying the application of gender in video game avatar creation. They’ve lived in Bloomington for
                    nine years and got married to Randall in fall 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the second grade, Xan has felt different from other kids. Relationships were hard for them. At
                    the time, Xan was sure they were a girl. They just thought they had to express that identity
                    differently. When they wore nails or dresses, it was upsetting and didn’t feel right. They used to
                    like these things when they were little, but they didn’t like how nails and dresses made people
                    perceive them. They weren’t sure why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xan enters the bathroom, sets their mug down on the vanity, unwraps the needle, pokes it into the
                    vial and starts filling the syringe up with testosterone. They take a quick glance at themselves in
                    the mirror. They’ve started to grow facial hair, and their voice is lower too. Their students use
                    their correct pronouns, and they have a good support system. It took their whole life to get here.

                    About 0.5% of the population of Indiana identifies as transgender. That is around 25,800 people,
                    according to data collected by the <a
                        href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/"
                        target="_blank">Williams Institute</a>. For the trans community, coming to terms with your
                    identity means interfacing with systems and people that feel owed an explanation. As a practice,
                    gender-affirming care asks for no explanation. It builds acceptance. It saves lives. For four
                    students at IU, gender-affirming care has helped them gain access to necessary therapies, surgeries,
                    and support. But red tape, insurance issues, and unqualified professionals can make getting this
                    care more difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These students receive care at the IU Student Health Center through the Gender Affirming Care Team,
                    but
                    gender-affirming care is more than just doctor visits and medicine. It is a partner who supports and
                    loves you unconditionally.

                    Dr. Laura Knudson leads IU’s Gender Affirming Care Team, which strives to influence the health
                    center’s protocols and operations to be as gender affirming as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Gender-affirmative health care can include any single or combination of a number of social,
                    psychological, behavioral or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions
                    designed to support and affirm an individual’s gender identity,” according to the World Health
                    Organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the health center, that care includes training nearly all of the center’s employees, including
                    janitorial staff, in being gender affirming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knudson works closely with center’s transgender clients. Her office is full of visual cues to
                    comfort her patients. On the walls are stickers representing different sexual orientations. She has
                    a diagram mounted in a frame titled the “gender unicorn.” It delineates the differences between
                    gender identity and gender expression. In another corner of the room hangs an art piece with
                    flowers, captioned with the phrase “grow your own gender.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xan decided they wanted to start hormone replacement therapy at the health center in October
                    2021. From there, it took two weeks of blood tests and consultations until they could access the
                    medication. Two weeks may not seem like a long time, but those two weeks were predicated upon over
                    10 years of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Once you get in the mind of ‘I want to start this,’ then it's agonizing waiting,” Xan said.

                        Check-ups can also be more frequent if the hormones cause negative side-effects. After the first
                        year of treatment, hormone therapy check-ups reduce in frequency to every six to 12 months.</p>

                <p>
                    The health center has eliminated some of the boundaries other organizations and
                    administrations fall into with gender-affirming care, Knudson said. Originally, hormone therapies
                    were not based on informed consent, and instead required letters from mental health professionals to
                    validate the care. These logistical trappings made it much harder to gain access to care, especially
                    with low-income students. Now at the center, HRT is based on informed consent, so letters aren’t
                    necessary. Trans people can also get informed consent HRT from Planned Parenthood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Family therapist Deborah Pardue said gender-affirming care saves lives. A <a
                        href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345113/" target="_blank">recent study</a> shows about
                    40% of transgender individuals have attempted suicide. Pardue said that rate is even higher when
                    factoring in those who succeed. That same study indicates 82% of trans people have thought about it
                    at some point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Once they get gender-affirming care, rates of suicide, depression and anxiety go down because
                    they're making progress to be who they are,” Pardue said. “It's really relieving for them.”

                    However, being gender affirming takes more than just providing medical care. Knudson takes time to
                    design the environment she works in so it is welcoming to her patients. Gender-affirming care
                    requires professionals to step out of the binary understanding of gender, she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Those kinds of changes are really necessary in health care to make sure that everyone is being
                    served,” she said.

                    Gender-affirming care was not as widespread in fall 2008 when Xan was in high school. When they were
                    17, they didn’t know how to process how they felt inside. They said subconsciously they felt they
                    were a feminine gay man.

                <p>
                    “But I wasn't. I was in a female body. I didn't know why,” Xan said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up in that environment meant being outwardly trans didn’t feel like an option.

                <p>
                    “The only other option was to fully deny it.”

                    Around that time, Xan developed a panic disorder. They still don’t fully know the reason why the
                    disorder developed, but the attacks kept them up most nights. By senior year of high school, they
                    said they felt like a husk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They weren’t particularly enthused to go on their college search. Like every kid, they were
                    overwhelmed by new places, new people, new everything. The last place they toured was Earlham
                    College in Richmond, Indiana.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xan said the tour was typical, but something about Earlham was different. Everything felt more
                    accepting and less expectant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That night on the dorm floor, Xan saw two girls asking students if they wanted their nails painted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I always admired people with fun nails,” they said. “But when I did it it felt like people were
                    seeing me as a woman doing it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    From very early on, Xan learned nails were a signifier, something that girls wore. Even though they
                    loved nails, they couldn’t bring themselves to try them on. But at Earlham, gender norms were
                    treated differently. There were masculine women and feminine men. Nails weren't weird or presumptive
                    of one’s gender.

                    Much to their own surprise, Xan got their nails painted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I remember my head being like, that is the last thing I would ever want to do,” they said. “But
                    then I just said yes.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    They don’t remember what color, but they know it was something dark — a black or purple perhaps. It
                    didn’t matter. For the first time, they could express themselves free of judgment. Their instinct
                    about Earlham was right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the night wrapped up, Xan wanted to sleep over, but that wasn’t the plan. At first, they didn’t
                    want to stay because of their panic attacks. However, some instinct was telling them it was going to
                    be okay, so they stayed.

                    Back in their house in Bloomington, Xan scours the house for one of their old journals, the one they
                    knew they wrote on the day they left Earlham.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Randall sits back and watches from the living room couch, smiling the way one smiles toward someone
                    they truly love. He wears an easy smile, one predicated upon years of experiences of hardships and
                    good times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I appreciate hearing a lot of this because so many things just track really strongly for me, where
                    I’m like ‘oh yeah, that's you,’” Randall said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He says he can see how these moments helped form who Xan is now. But he knows these things aren’t so
                    one-to-one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xan eventually found the journal. Written on the bottom of the page is a simple message.

                    Looking back, Xan said their time at Earlham through undergrad was healthy, but they say it also
                    postponed their transition. They were still operating as though they were a woman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The years between Earlham and now were tumultuous, filled with further denial and some of what Xan
                    considers internalized transphobia. It wasn’t until after their wedding in 2021 when Xan started
                    HRT.

                    Once Xan decided they wanted hormones, they started within weeks. This was partly due to the
                    insurance provided through IU for graduate students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of Knudson’s new patients did not qualify for that insurance, meaning they had to shop. They
                    were not optimistic the center would accept their insurance.

                <p>
                    Some states have protections requiring insurance companies to cover gender-affirming care, but
                    Indiana is not one of those states. The <a href="https://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports/#2015report"
                        target="_blank">2015 U.S. Trans Survey</a> shows 25% of trans people were denied
                    coverage for hormone therapy in the U.S. While the health center tries to reduce these problems, the
                    patient’s coverage was still denied due their insurance not being accepted.

                    Dr. Knudson recommended them to apply for a grant that would cover all medical visits, exempting the
                    testosterone. Eventually, they could receive the care they needed.

                    The way institutional aid looks outside of the center is less clear-cut.

                    “Some of the stuff that has been good and supportive was because of the actions of individuals, and
                    not necessarily because of institutional support,” IU graduate student Erin Ewart said.

                    When Erin began publicly identifying as a woman, she forgot about things like her graduate student
                    photo online needing to be updated. It took the person in charge of the photos to realize that need
                    rather than it being an expectation of the university to reach out.

                        is roughly average for the Midwest regarding legal transition protections, which includes gender
                        neutral markers on licenses and having an easily understandable name-change process.</p>

                        organization docks points for 'negative laws' which make the legal transition process harder.

                    Pardue said these barriers can include requiring letters from medical professionals like herself as
                    well as extensive wait times. She said there is also difficulty in finding a doctor who is
                    adequately and competently trained to conduct gender-affirming surgery.

                    Xan knew they wanted top surgery before they were sure they wanted HRT. When it came time to look
                    for places to get surgery, they were advised to look out of state. That led them and Randall to Dr.
                    Haruko Okada, a plastic surgeon in Ohio who specializes in gender-affirming surgeries. Within a
                    six-month period, Xan was admitted to surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xan spent the days leading up to their top surgery oscillating between confidence and extreme
                    nervousness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “My mornings: I'd wake up and be like, ‘I can do this.’ Evenings were like, ‘everyone's gonna think
                    I'm insane,’” Xan said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were concerned people wouldn’t understand why they needed to change their body like this. They
                    had similar struggles once they started on testosterone. Would people understand and respect their
                    choice?

                <p>
                    The surgery also fell right before their qualifying exams for their Ph.D. candidacy. This meant Xan
                    studied up to the surgery, then spent their spring break recovering, before beginning exams. It made
                    the whole process all the more stressful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although, many moments leading to the surgery were enjoyable for Xan. Days before they left for
                    Ohio, they would often observe themselves amusedly — their breasts would soon be gone. At one point,
                    they began to speculate with Randall about how heavy they would weigh. Their mom asked the same
                    question. When the day finally came for Xan to pack for their trip, they realized they would only
                    need one bra. And it could be their favorite bra.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the car ride into the medical facility, Xan was tense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were waiting in the pre-surgery room, hooked up to an IV and sitting in a hospital gown. They
                    sat in their curtained-off section, waiting with other patients. A nurse came in to talk to
                    Xan before they were admitted. The nurse told them they were the fourth person that week to receive
                    top surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It was the first time I felt like I wasn’t the only one doing this,” Xan said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The surgery was successful. By the time they got to their hotel, Xan was loopy on post-op drugs and
                    talking about how great it was that the nurse kept getting their pronouns right. Everything went
                    perfectly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It was just so casual,” they said. “Just really casual.”

                        Transitioning is the process a person undergoes in order to align their gender expression or
                        body with their gender identity. Transitioning can include medical, legal and social aspects and
                        these steps, which can also be referred to as gender affirming care, can vary from person to
                        person. Our story shares the experiences of transgender individuals and their access to gender
                        affirming care in Bloomington and IU.

                    Gender-affirming spaces do exist outside of the IU Student Health Center, albeit through less
                    official means. IU freshman Elliot Wilson said his community at the Collins Living Learning Center
                    has been very supportive. The center is known for being very queer friendly, Elliot said, and he
                    knows a lot of trans people there.

                <p>
                    Elliot isn’t focused on how he identifies. Right now, he’s just focused on feeling as good as he
                    can. The same is true for Xan as they don’t have a concrete label.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The most concrete is transmasculine nonbinary, but that's as concrete as I'm gonna get,” they said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is what they consider to be their gender identity. They say it allows them the flexibility to
                    be who they are. They said they like to push back on cisgender people when they ask the label
                    question. Cisgender people don’t have to answer those kinds of questions, so they don’t ask
                    themselves those questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a tattoo on Xan’s right forearm. It is of the hanged man — a tarot card — and is
                    representative of surrender. The card depicts a person, suspended by their ankle by a rope from a
                    post. The sun illuminates from behind their head. Xan’s version is special. They have top surgery
                    scars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sitting in the waiting room for their first testosterone injection appointment, that tarot card kept
                    coming to mind. It always unnerved them. It displays someone allowing themself to die. But something
                    about the card suddenly clicked in their mind. Surrendering to the unknowns of their experience —
                    their past and their future, who they are and who they want to become — all of it is knotted into
                    the figure attached to their arm.
                </p>

                    alt="Image of Xan presenting the tattoo of The Hanged Man on their forearm.">
                <figcaption>Xan’s tattoo is of the hanged man tarot card, but with top surgery scars and symbolizes the
                    embracement of the unknown in transitioning, letting go and “ it's kind of a mixture of that with
                    like, you're, kind of like where your power is coming from.” The hanged man card, Xan said, used to
                    freak them out but they suddenly understood the card’s meaning while waiting for their testosterone
                    injection appointments early in their medical transition. </figcaption>
                <p>
                    Day by day, Xan finds themselves more comfortable in life. They get acknowledged as masculine in
                    public. Guys fist bump them on the street. These small things make a big difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I knew that this is what I had always wanted to do,” Xan said. “They can see me.”
