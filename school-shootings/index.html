                                GREENSBURG, IN – The school resource officer’s alarm went off at 5 a.m. that Wednesday. 
                                It was still dark outside as Bruce Copple got dressed in his matching navy-blue khakis 
                                and windbreaker and made his first cup of coffee for 
                                the day, which he took with just a little bit of sugar.

                            <p>The moon was still high in the sky as Copple drove his unmarked police car to the Greensburg Community School
                                 District campus. That morning, like every morning, he arrived at 6 a.m., long 
                                 before anyone else, and walked through every empty hall of the building and the athletic fields outside, 
                                 looking for anything — not just an intruder, but a leaking pipe, broken glass or even animals that had wandered inside
                                  — that may pose a safety threat.</p>

                                      Bruce Copple laughs April 26, 2023 during his morning round at Greensburg Elementary School in Greensburg, Indiana.

                            <p>
                                Copple stopped at the district’s administration building for his daily briefing with the superintendent
                                then headed for his favorite stop of the morning: Greensburg Elementary School.
                                Picking up a stack of newspapers dropped outside the lobby, Copple
                                was immediately greeted by children’s drawings of boats and a large banner exclaiming
                                the building was “Home to the Pirates!” It was officially time for his second cup of coffee.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Just shortly before the clock hit 7:30 a.m. Copple, who has served as an SRO for 20 years and
                                 will be retiring at the end of the year, stationed himself in a corridor intersecting the three entrances of the school, 
                                the cafeteria doors behind him. It was time for his favorite part of his routine as SRO: saying hello to the students.

                                The doors opened and pre-school students ran in towards the cafeteria, swiftly followed
                                 by the older students enrolled in the Pre-K through 5th grade school.
                                 It was impossible for Copple to take more than three steps without being intercepted by a student’s hug.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though he has only been permanently stationed in Greensburg Elementary School for a year, 
                                Copple was able to remember almost all the students’ names as they walked through the doors. 
                                Quick to deliver a high five or fist bump to those passing by, 
                                some students took the opportunity to pull Copple off to the side.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>One fifth grader demanded an answer. "Is this shirt blue?" she asked Copple. "My class is supposed to wear blue today, and my friend says this isn’t blue!"</p>

                            <p>“Well, I think that is definitely blue,” Copple responded. The fifth grader happily relayed his final decision to her peer, claiming that she had known she was right all along.</p>

                            <p>Not wanting to go back on his word, Copple set off down the hall with the student. 
                                After a quick walk to the third-grade classroom, he wished the student good luck with her day.
                                 Victoria, of course, thanked him with a hug.</p>
                             <p> 
                                Copple is now in his 41st year in law enforcement, all of which he has spent serving in Greensburg.
                                 He spent the first 18 of his years in law enforcement working as a street cop. Copple served as an 
                                 investigator for three years, mostly working on cases against youths — cases he believes
                                  “would make a lot of people quit the job and get out of it.” 
                                He said he wasn’t ready for the emotional attachment to people that his job as an SRO required.

                                serving as an SRO — he’s never gotten tired of working with students and their families. For Copple,
                                 being an SRO has always been about building relationships with people, not just combating violence in schools. On

                                 Copple remembers a time when his job was not overshadowed by fears of school shootings — before Sandy Hook,
                                 Uvalde and Parkland made national headlines. With retirement awaiting him at the end of the school year, 
                                 Copple has watched how the field of 
                                school-based policing has evolved to focus on safety protocols and hardening school facilities against intruders.

                                where he would&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;felonies&nbsp;and&nbsp;have&nbsp;people attack him, 
                                Copple said he never expected to be working in schools. In 2000, Copple was introduced to school
                                 policing when he began leading a 
                                 chapter of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sadd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Students

                                in the high school building. Since then, Copple has continued to do things he never 
                                would have imagined, from surprising a young student at his police-themed birthday party 
                                to delivering bags of food to students during the COVID-19 lockdown. 
                                Copple emotionally recalled how he was even able to walk one of his students halfway down 
                                the aisle at her wedding.

                                For the first five years of his career in the schools, Copple was the only SRO for
                                 the entire Greensburg Community School Corporation. With his office stationed out of the high school,
                                  he would often spend his days jumping
                                 back and forth between the four district buildings on campus, all within 1.2 miles of each other. 
                            </p>
                            <p>This past year, however, he decided to become fully stationed in the elementary school building following 
                                a shooting at&nbsp;

The tragedy, which shocked SROs across the nation, convinced Copple to hire a 
                                fourth full-time officer for the district and move to permanently work in the elementary school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Kara Holdsworth, principal of Greensburg Elementary School, has worked with Copple for all nine years of her employment
                                     in the district. Holdsworth described Copple as the &ldquo;father of safety for Greensburg schools.&rdquo; She said having SROs in 
                                    the building makes herself, other faculty,&nbsp;students&nbsp;and
                                    community members feel safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                  enjoyed completing puzzles, Copple started creating brain teasers for the student to complete when

                                    word search to logic puzzles. Shortly before lunch, Copple gave her a

                                    In addition to building relationships with students, Copple said his main aspiration in his work is
                                     to educate those around him. For instance, Copple started a partnership with Decatur County Memorial Hospital 
                                     to train all district employees in CPR 
                                     and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stopthebleed.org/training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&ldquo;Stop the Bleed,&rdquo;</a> a

                            <p>Several years ago, Copple decided to take his passion for education a step further: earning 
                                his workplace specialist teaching license, the license now framed and hanging on his office wall. 
                                Copple enrolled in an online course through Ball State University. While enrolled in the course, 
                                Copple was still working as a full time SRO. He recalled many late nights in his office&nbsp;writing&nbsp;essays 
                                and completing assignments&nbsp;&mdash;which he said his wife Paula was not pleased about. Copple planned to launch a

                            <p>Greensburg High School senior Emily Coy took the
                                 class and said she enjoyed going into public and learning how to work with emergency medical services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It was thrilling,&rdquo; Coy said. &ldquo;Copple&nbsp;did&nbsp;a great job&nbsp;while he 
                                was&nbsp;here&nbsp;and he was always supportive of the
                                kids and protecting them. That was his top&nbsp;priority&nbsp;and he filled that role very well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>In a district of about 2,000 students, Copple said he connected with students, such as 
                                    Emily, individually. However,&nbsp;less&nbsp;people in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rural town&nbsp;often means fewer resources 
                                    for the school and surrounding community.

                            <p>Copple said he and many other SROs working in rural parts of the state face&nbsp;additional&nbsp;barriers 
                                to helping their students and families. For instance, Copple said he will occasionally have to personally drive 
                                students seeking mental health or substance abuse intervention at least an hour away to more populated areas such as 
                                Indianapolis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bloomington. While Greensburg has a local hospital and guidance counseling center, 
                                he said&nbsp;appropriate mental&nbsp;health resources are not&nbsp;always&nbsp;available in the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>Copple said pressure to improve school safety measures in recent years has also put significant financial strains 
                                on the small district. He said the district is currently looking to install new door security systems and add film 
                                to all classroom door windows to prevent people from seeing inside. Some experts value

                                Implementing new security systems can be expensive, often costing districts tens of thousands of dollars a month.</p>

                            <p>An increase in school gun violence is something Copple and other SROs have had to 
                                grapple with. In 2022, Copple visited Columbine High School as part of an annual National 
                                Association of School Resource Officers conference hosted in Aurora, Colorado. Surrounded by other SROs, 
                                he visited a memorial recognizing the 20th&nbsp;year anniversary of a shooting at the school which left 12 
                                students and one teacher dead. He said that the high school, which has become symbolic for gun violence across the country, 
                                looked just like any other school you would drive by across the country. Here, he listened to parents talk about the deaths of 
                                their children in the school, saying the visit reminded 
                                him how the tragedy&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and many others like it&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;were preventable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>According to data 
                                from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/school-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington 
                                    Post</a>, there have been 386&nbsp;school shootings since 1999, the year of the shooting at Columbine High School.
                                     Copple said for him, Columbine was &ldquo;the first of modern times, but by no means the first.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Copple said it is hard to gauge the impact Columbine has had on the culture surrounding school safety.</p>
                            <p class="section-break">***</p>
                            <p>Copple said there are tough mental and physical impacts that come along with&nbsp;an&nbsp;SRO&rsquo;s&nbsp;job. While 
                                there has never been a gun fired in his school, Copple recalled close calls, such as when a student brought a firearm into the classroom. Another time, Copple said a teacher, who had been laid off, shot themselves with a firearm in the Greensburg Elementary School parking lot.&nbsp;Copple can still remember the details of this incident, pointing 
                                to the approximate location of where the death occurred, which was visible from the school playground.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>The grueling and unsettling parts of an SRO&rsquo;s job can be difficult to grapple with, 
                                especially for younger officers, Copple said. Passionate about helping other SROs adjust and form connections 
                                with students in their work, Copple became an instructor for the National Association of School Resource Officers. 
                                While he has been on the NASRO leadership board for several years, Copple taught his first basic SRO training course in
                                 Indianapolis this past March. Present at the training were SROs from across Indiana from Fort Wayne to Seymour to Bloomington.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>NASRO emphasizes a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasro.org/clientuploads/NASRO_BestPractices21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&ldquo;Triad Model&rdquo;</a> for SROs, where officers are trained to fulfill three types of roles: a law enforcement officer, a public safety educator and an informal counselor&nbsp;or&nbsp;mentor. To train officers to fulfill informal counselor&nbsp;or&nbsp;mentor duties, NASRO includes a lecture on &ldquo;trauma informed
                                 practices&rdquo; in each basic SRO training. When teaching this lesson, Copple began by asking the officers to engage in an exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>Handing each officer five post-it notes, he asked everyone to write down different things they do each day, 
                                but without any details. For instance, rather than writing &ldquo;I ate breakfast&rdquo;,&nbsp;one would write &ldquo;I ate.&rdquo; Copple then 
                                asked each officer to switch post-its and try to 
                                order each post-it in the sequence they believed the other officer intended it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>Within a few minutes the officers discussed the orders of the post-it notes, and 
                                one thing became clear: the actions were often organized in an order the original officer did not intend. 
                                Just like the officers made assumptions about each other, SROs can be quick to assume things about their students, Copple said. 
                                Many of the students they will encounter in their daily work might not have the basic daily routines that one might assume, such as having a bed to sleep in, being able to brush their teeth or eating three meals a day. 
                                Realizing how students’ lives can be vastly different from their own was crucial to the job, he said.

                            <p>In June, Copple retired from law enforcement. He said the last several days of the school year were “very emotional and tough” as he 
                                said goodbye to the students and staff of 
                                Greensburg Community Schools. During his last week, Copple said faculty had a small celebration for his last days of work.
