                        Each of these <figure>s contains one of the images
                        Each image has an "object-position" style set
                            This determines the focal point of the image. So if you make the screen smaller,
                            that certain point of the photo will remain in the frame. Make sure to check how
                            each photo looks in a mobile view, and update those styles accordingly to avoid
                            cutting off important parts of the image, like the top of someone's head
                        Each image also has alt text, which will appear if the photo doesn't load, such as if 
                            the viewer has slow internet, and is important for people who use screen readers
                            so they know what's going on.
