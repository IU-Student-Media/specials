                <p>One girl has a baby doll arm glued to the side of her mouth. Another man has a false ear strung
                    around his neck. The ear brings a grimace and a “gross” from Jodi, a short-haired blonde grandmother
                    of two who calls herself “of uncertain age.” She’s busy blending out age lines and fake freckles on
                    a cannibalistic granny in her makeup chair.</p>

                        quickly transform actors into each character in the park, and often spends time teaching other
                        makeup artists.﻿

                    hand flying to her throat, before she realizes what happened and laughs.</p>
                <p>“Well, that was frightening!” she says, trying to catch her breath. The cannibals laugh, and she

                    of the extraordinary. She’s been at the park since day one and has designed the looks for every
                    attraction.</p>
                <p>Now, over 150 actors in black gather outside the makeup trailer. They cluster together around picnic
                    tables — laughing, snacking, talking quietly. In the next two hours, each and every one will become
                    gaunt, bloody and on the verge of death beneath the brush of Jodi and her team.</p>

                    actors gather to hang out and get ready for an evening of scaring. Jodi said earlier sunsets mean
                    earlier deadlines for her team, because the park can open its outdoor attractions earlier.

                        heading

                <p>Stepping into the makeup trailer, the early-evening chill lifts. The unit is heated and
                    air-conditioned, one of many changes since the park was founded. Inside, dirt-scuffed, faux-wood
                    flooring makes way for nine plastic carts — one for each of Jodi’s team and Jodi herself. Each cart
                    is filled with sponges, brushes and containers of face paint and grisly-named makeup.</p>
                <p>On one cart, a pink plastic paint brush sticks straight out of a clear container, marked “Fresh
                    Scab,” that's half-full of a dark, thick red jelly that, Jodi assures her victims, will easily come
                    off with hot water and a baby wipe. Next to Jodi’s purse, which is massive, taupe and fringed,
                    there’s Ben Nye in Cadaver Grey and Death Flesh. Jodi is visibly excited as she starts pulling out
                    makeup “wheels,” which have a variety of colors to achieve different effects.</p>

                        actors into creepy zombies in just a couple of minutes.

                    you have…” she finishes patting the creamy makeup down, “...a bruise.”</p>

                <p>Her hand is now marked by a fake purple-blue-yellow-green-brown bruise that looks like she whacked
                    it, <em>hard</em>, against a table. It’s gone with a couple swipes of a makeup wipe.</p>
                <p>Jodi’s been doing makeup for a long time. By age 10, she was gluing on false eyelashes for dance.
                    Later, at Purdue University, she took a class in stage makeup. She said she’s a theatrical person
                    and liked learning how to make someone look like something else.</p>

                <p>She called starting at the park a fluke. She was looking for something different, and she saw the job
                    posting on Craigslist; she knew stage makeup, so she applied. Within the first year, she’d become
                    the team’s manager. When she was having trouble getting staff, she trained family members and
                    friends. She would pack them all into her car and drive them up with her.</p>
                <p>“I was their mom, so they had to do what I said,” Jodi said. “And I knew they were going to be on
                    time, because they were in my car.”</p>


                <p>Recently, her 6-year-old granddaughter saw her getting ready to wash a bag of bloody brushes. Jodi
                    told her they were from the park, and her granddaughter paused for a moment, then said she wanted to
                    learn Scream Park makeup.</p>
                <p>When Jodi sent a photo of the fake-bloody “cut” her granddaughter had given herself to the girl’s
                    mother, she got a text back: her daughter-in-law had gasped before realizing, “oh, yeah, I forgot
                    she was at your house.”</p>

                <p>Group by group, actors start filing in. The first group to need full-face makeup are clowns, who Jodi
                    says people already think are creepy. They don’t even need blood. As her steady hand paints wide
                    strokes of white across an actor’s forehead, he asks her if she’s seen “Hocus Pocus 2” yet. He
                    stayed up until 3 a.m. to watch it. She says she’s impressed.</p>
                <p>Jodi takes a step back and nods, satisfied. With flicks of her brush, she’s given him an
                    over-exaggerated, neon-pink smile. She grabs a small spray bottle from the cart.</p>
                <p>“You ready?”</p>
                <p>The clown gives a quick nod and sucks in a breath. Jodi spritzes once, twice, ten times, then
                    <em>thwack!</em>
                    She snaps open a lacy, blue handheld fan, and the breeze ghosts over the clown’s grim smile.

                <p>Jodi’s team for the night consists of eight girls. At first glance, they don’t look similar: ranging
                    in age from 17 to 23, buzzed hair to long curls. They wear short plaid skirts and huge sweatshirts
                    and band tees. But they have a few things in common: the candy-colored aprons they wear, the
                    concentration that seeps into their brows each time an actor sits in their chair and a love for the
                    creepy, scary and gross.</p>
                <p>The makeup team members come from all over. Some are in school to become aestheticians, some are what
                    Jodi calls “home chefs” and practice with their own eyeshadow and Elmer’s glue. Some are just
                    artistic.</p>
                <p>Regardless, at the beginning of the season, they learn the grossest tricks of the trade. How to make
                    a cut, that latex and Kleenex together on a cheekbone gouges out a chunk of skin. That oatmeal on
                    skin looks like it’s flaking off, and that grains of rice look like maggots when they’re placed
                    right.</p>

                    own name, though, stays simple black ink. After all, when your name’s on the schedule that
                    consistently, every night from Sept. 30 to Oct. 31, you don’t need a fancy color.</p>

                    gashes across his slick, shiny red face.</p>
                <p>His name is Joseph Lee Myers, and he’s been there for 11 years. He sees Jodi multiple times a week.
                    She helps him get into character, he said, and it gives him energy.</p>
                <p>“Don’t tell her what to do. Don’t be bossy towards her,” Myers said. “She’ll give you what she wants
                    to give you to fit the part.”</p>
                <p>The park keeps its visitors off-balance, Jodi said. Between flashing lights and the expectation
                    created by a haunted house, the anticipation gets people.</p>

                <p>Making the actors look like something else is part of their character development, and it’s what

                    works in an office. She’s a grandmother. Faces aren’t falling off.</p>
                <p>The park is different; it’s outside of day-to-day life. She keeps coming back, despite the hour-plus
                    round trip and the late nights and the 13 Halloweens her kids have spent without her there. To Jodi,
                    there’s something addicting about it.</p>
