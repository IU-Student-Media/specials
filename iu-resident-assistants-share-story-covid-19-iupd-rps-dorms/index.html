            <p>Resident assistants and community educators are the front-line workers that operate IU's <a href="https://admissions.indiana.edu/life/housing.html" target="_blank" class="story-link">residence halls and apartments</a>. Hundreds of students and staff work tirelessly to create safe environments conducive to a positive living and learning experience for IU&rsquo;s residents.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic makes an already demanding job more taxing. Residential staff are unknowingly exposed to infected residents on a routine basis. On top of that, mismanagement and lack of transparency from IU&rsquo;s <a href="https://housing.indiana.edu/" target="_blank" class="story-link">Residential Programs and Services</a> has sowed chaos in IU&rsquo;s coronavirus response, further endangering residents and staff alike.</p>
            <p>If we claim to be &ldquo;in this together,&rdquo; then we need to protect and compensate the workers who risk their health everyday to uphold the IU student experience. Many of the concerns shared in the following testimonies are not new. Rather, they are a reflection of long-standing frustration among staff, brought to fruition by a university that opened its residence halls during a pandemic.</p>
            <p>Rumors of not being allowed to speak to press circulate within residential staff circles. While no such policy exists on paper, residential staff understand the risks of gambling the job that gives you a place to sleep. To respect this, some of the following sources have been kept anonymous in order to safeguard the jobs and livelihoods of IU&rsquo;s residential staff.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Indiana Daily Student spoke to two former and 10 current RA&rsquo;s. This is the RA experience, in their own words.</p>

            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many unprecedented challenges to IU&rsquo;s residence halls. Despite IU&rsquo;s policies and safety measures to combat the spread of the virus, there are many shortcomings. Residential staff are not notified by IU when one of their residents is diagnosed. Quarantine measures using <a href="https://housing.indiana.edu/resources/quarantineandisolation/index.html" target="_blank" class="story-link">Ashton Hall</a> have been <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2020/10/iu-ashton-quarantine-little-supervision" target="_blank" class="story-link">loosely enforced</a>.</p>

One time, we had residents who said they didn’t need to wear masks because they had COVID-19 before. Freshmen are usually the most egregious violators of COVID-19 policies, when it comes to parties and things like that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We had a scenario where a resident contacted another RA saying their COVID-19 positive roommate was able to get back into their dorm room. They’re supposed to lock out residents with COVID-19 once they get reassigned to Ashton. That didn’t seem to happen.”</p>

            <P>&ldquo;Also, information is not provided to staff. Each time that someone on the floor got a positive result, I would only be informed if they told me. Many times, contact tracing would not contact individuals who were around infected individuals or that frequently shared spaces such as bathrooms with them.

            <p>It is important to recognize that residential staff are still students, with classes, families and extracurricular involvements. Juggling a demanding job along with the normal responsibilities that come with being a student is burdensome for anyone. Poor working conditions coupled with lack of support for residential staff disregards the importance of mental health.</p>

            <p>“My first year as an RA, I was a first responder to a student suicide. After the fact, I was given no support from anywhere within the organization for three days. I had no contact with my supervisor during that time until he called me into his office, threatened to fire me, and told me that my response to the trauma I had experienced was inappropriate. Contained in this threat was the implication that he could make me homeless and take away my access to food overnight, two weeks before final exams, and that there was nothing I could do about it. It was not until I appealed this to the head of RPS, nearly five days after the student's death, that anyone asked me how I — or the student’s I was responsible for — were handling the situation.”</p>

            <p>“As a first year RA, I was excited to enter a role where I could help students. Unfortunately, my three months as an RA have not been like that. I have been gaslighted by my leadership team and the higher ups at RPS. I do not feel supported. We do so much for our jobs, yet it is never enough. They keep adding more and more, and we are already busy enough with COVID-19 policy. There is no policy in place for people who test positive. Whenever we complain to our bosses all we hear is ‘We are here for you. We see you. We appreciate you.’ In all my time here, however, I am not appreciated. My mental state has never been so low. My leadership team will not communicate with me, and they are not willing to help. I'm sick and tired of the conditions, but whenever we try to speak out we get beaten down.”</p>

            <p>“Bias training came in late November, or maybe early December, which is the end of the first semester. So nobody knew how to write bias incident reports before that. We were told verbatim, ‘The most important reason for bias training was so that future students still decide to come back.’ Our supervisor relayed a story about how someone saw a video of somebody at IU saying the n-word and that this student revoked their commitment to IU. That was the story that they gave me as the example of why bias incident reports are important, not because it actually affected that student, but because IU lost money.”</p>
            <p>“I had never gotten a B in college, except for that semester. I got three, and that’s because I couldn't actually get out of my bed to leave some days.

            <p>Communication between leadership and residential staff has been historically strained. Due to lack of direct representation in RPS decision-making, residential staff have little to no say in decisions that affect their day-to-day responsibilities. This mismanagement is reflected in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in the seemingly ineffective training that has not addressed recurrent concerns from residential staff.</p>

            <p>“Another frustration of mine is the lack of representation that we get in RPS. We don’t really get any say during their meetings or express what we have to say. We have our supervisors who go and take what we have to say, but by the time it gets through them it gets kind of washed down and made to seem like it is not a big deal. So that’s definitely frustrating, but that has been a problem forever. The directors are always trying to pander to us and say ‘Oh, we support you,’ but it’s just words. There is no action.”</p>

So, morale has been very low.﻿”</p>
            ﻿<p>“My number one concern would probably be money. Because I can't say how they should change the job and obviously there has to be people doing our job. But if they really want to show that they value us as people, and not just like cogs in a machine, then they need to give us hazard pay. They need to give us enough to live off of. Yes, we get housing and a meal plan, but that housing puts us in the middle of a communal living situation so we're more at risk.”</p>

If you want to be an RA who isn’t mentally broken from being another cog in the police machine, you have to purposefully not do your job and hope you don’t get caught. There is no safety net put in place for our housing that so many of us are financially dependent on if we get fired.﻿”</p>

            <p>Most residential staff genuinely enjoy connecting with residents and being a resource for their peers. Whether it be through late-night wellness checks, community building events or dozens of lost weekends spent monitoring the residence hall, RAs foster the experiences that make IU congenial.

            <p>Residential staff want to make the university better. But when they live in constant fear of retribution, it becomes impossible to discuss the hard issues that would improve IU’s residence halls. To get out of this together, RPS must guarantee residential staff basic job security when grievances are raised. Concerns that are raised should be treated with the credence and respect they deserve.﻿</p>
