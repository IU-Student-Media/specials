<p>Meghan Wu imagined the place where they kept her friend&rsquo;s body would be dark and cold. But the room was filled with yellow light. There was a slight floral scent in the air from the flowers on display. </p><p>Wu saw Yaolin Wang lying on the dressing table, covered by a cream colored blanket. Yaolin&rsquo;s eyes were closed, eyelashes curled neatly. Wu was almost convinced Yaolin was just sleeping. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not dead,&rdquo; Wu thought.</p><p>If Wu were alone, she would have called Yaolin&rsquo;s name over and over until she woke up.</p><p>When friends first heard the news that Yaolin was dead, they assumed Daniel Xiao was her killer, even before police confirmed. </p><p>A close friend heard her crying when Xiao locked her out of her apartment. A roommate in Seattle saw the welts he left on her body. A friend in Bloomington let her stay in her apartment when she needed shelter.</p><p>When her friends put the bits information they each had together, the image of an abuser came into focus. Now, they helplessly relive the moments that could have kept Yaolin alive.</p><p>***</p><p>Police first responded to a 911 call reporting a suicide in the Stratum apartments near College Mall. Daniel Xiao&rsquo;s body had been found in a stairwell. When police arrived at the scene, they discovered Yaolin Wang&rsquo;s body on a nearby patio. (call and ask about blood trail)</p><p>From the beginning, officers worked under the assumption that the case was a murder-suicide. Police were led to believe initially that the two were in a &ldquo;mutually romantic relationship,&rdquo; said Capt. Joe Qualters of the Bloomington Police Department.</p><p>As the investigation continued, police began to uncover evidence that led them to believe Daniel was forcing the relationship.</p><p>&ldquo;This other side emerged about how controlling he was,&rdquo; Qualters said. &ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t your typical relationship at all.&rdquo;</p><p>Yaolin and Daniel met this year during their spring semester at North Seattle College. Daniel soon became Yaolin&rsquo;s second roommate. </p><p>Accounts from close friends detail a pattern of abuse in the weeks and months following. Yaolin never told her family, the police or any school official. </p><p>Daniel arrived in Bloomington on August 22, according to a police statement, where he stayed in Yaolin&rsquo;s apartment for 29 days. He left on Sept. 19,and said he intended to go back to school at Edmonds College in Seattle. </p><p>Daniel re-appeared in Bloomington unannounced on Sept. 30. Yaolin texted her roommate in Bloomingon, Susan Zhang, at 2:01 p.m.: &ldquo;My nightmare is back.&rdquo; Yaolin had run into Daniel on her way out of her apartment. </p><p>Her roommate told her not to panic. Later that evening, she was dead, stabbed by Daniel for reasons still not completely understood by police.</p><p>&ldquo;I pray to God that she didn&rsquo;t suffer,&rdquo; said Eric Powell, XX with the XX funeral home. </p><p>Powell was responsible for dressing Yaolin&rsquo;s body for the funeral. He said it was apparent her body had been through a lot of trauma. But the details of her wounds are unknown &mdash; the Monroe County coroner failed to respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>After Yaolin&rsquo;s funeral, Powell went home and hugged his own daughter. He thanked God he still could, knowing Yaolin&rsquo;s father no longer could do the same.</p><p>A pattern of abuse</p><p>Gloria, Yaolin&rsquo;s roommate in Seattle, saw Daniel badger Yaolin and force himself into her room against her will. She heard the fighting in Yaolin&rsquo;s room. When the noise died down, Daniel would come out, polite and acting like nothing happened.</p><p>Gloria never suspected Daniel was abusive until the night he pushed and threatened her.</p><p>That night, the yelling started again. Except this time, Gloria could hear someone being pushed on to a dresser and Yaolin&rsquo;s screaming. The fight no longer seemed normal.</p><p>Gloria walked up to Yaolin&rsquo;s door and knocked.</p><p>When Yaolin opened the door, Gloria could see a bright red mark on Yaolin&rsquo;s forehead and finger marks on her waist. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rsquo; Yaolin said to her. &lsquo;Everything is fine.&rsquo;</p><p>Daniel appeared and seemed irritated. His face, no longer familiar, scared Gloria. Still, she told him she couldn&rsquo;t tolerate such loud, physical violence. Daniel pushed Gloria with both hands, hard. </p><p>She was shocked, scared and then cried out loud. Yaolin jumped in front of her, protecting her from Daniel.</p><p>Daniel pushed Yaolin and her to the living room. Gloria couldn&rsquo;t stop crying.</p><p>When she said she wanted to call the police, Daniel threatened &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you dare to call police, my family is powerful back in China.&rdquo;</p><p>So no police were called.</p><p>***</p><p>Date, around 7 p.m. Yaolin was packing for a trip back to China. She wouldn&rsquo;t have to endure any more abuse. </p><p>But Daniel took away her passport and stopped her from packing.</p><p>She messaged Meghan &ldquo;help me, he won&rsquo;t let me leave for China.&rdquo;</p><p>Daniel then took away her phone.</p><p>After a couple of hours, Yaolin took her phone back, stole away to the bathroom and messaged her friends for help.   When Meghan got home and finally saw Yaolin&rsquo;s messages, it was around midnight.</p><p>She called a cab, and dragged a friend along with her to get Yaolin. When they arrived, Yaolin moved her suitcases out of her room one by one. </p><p>After Yaolin got in the cab, Daniel started calling her. She picked up.</p><p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t leave, are you going to kill me?&rdquo; Meghan remembers her saying.   By the time they got back to Meghan&rsquo;s place, it was 4 a.m.. Exhausted by the night, no one said much. Yaolin hung up on another call from Daniel. </p><p>&ldquo;I have to go back,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>Yaolin had left a suitcase at the apartment, and Daniel said she would never see it again unless she came back.  No one seems to know what happened afterwards except that Yaolin was able to get on a plane to the Beijing airport, where her father was waiting.   He hadn&rsquo;t seen his daughter in a while. Her father was shocked when he first saw how bony Yaolin was when she walked up to him. His heart ached when Yaolin rushed into his chest and started crying.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you miss me too much?&rdquo; he joked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>What happened? Did someone bully you? Talk to Dad, let me help you.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked up, hesitated a moment then shook her head.</p><p> &ldquo;No, everything will be fine now.&rdquo;</p><p>***   Xu Gao, who shared a hotel room with Yaolin when they first arrived IU, overheard a guy on the phone, pleading, begging, badgering Yaolin to let him come to Bloomington. </p><p>She heard him promising that he would behave himself. So Yaolin caved, Gao said, and agreed to pick him up from the airport on August 22. </p><p>Knowing Yaolin wanted to get rid of the guy, Gao asked why. Yaolin guessed he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep his promise to behave.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I will definitely have an excuse to get rid of him,&rdquo; Yaolin told Gao.    And indeed, two weeks after Daniel&rsquo;s arrival, the abuse came back, worse than before.   On Sept. 10th, she was locked out of her own apartment again. She messaged Susan saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>Yaolin wanted to ask for the leasing office&rsquo;s help. Her roommate tried to stop her, saying&#20107;&#24773;&#38393;&#22823;&#20102;&#12290;Yaolin called the office anyway, and someone came to disable the deadbolt on her door, Susan said.</p><p>Daniel was sitting in the living room, acting like nothing happened. She messaged her roommate again.</p><p>&ldquo;I will call police after I get back from school tonight,&rdquo; Susan remembers Yaolin telling her. &ldquo;I know the result might be bad, even if I have to go back to China, even if I have to leave I will call police.&rdquo;</p><p>Susan tried persuade Yaolin to not call.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen to me, you are both students who have to go to school, no need to put police in this situation, right?&rdquo; Susan said in a message to Yaolin.</p><p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know the situation I&rsquo;m in,&rdquo; Susan recalls Yaolin telling her. &ldquo;I have no other way anymore.&rdquo;   But again, she didn&rsquo;t call the police.   Four days later, Gao received a WeChat message from Yaolin at 1:23 a.m.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you awake? I got beaten.&rdquo;</p><p>Gao asked Yaolin to come over. Yaolin said she couldn&rsquo;t &mdash; Daniel was beating her and wouldn&rsquo;t let her out of his sight.</p><p>Yaolin managed to sneak out around 7 a.m. that morning and lived in Gao&rsquo;s apartment for two days.</p><p>Two days after, her dad came to visit from China to celebrate Yaolin&rsquo;s 21st birthday. On the last day of her father&rsquo;s visit, Daniel packed his suitcases and left the apartment. He told Susan he was going back to Seattle.   Yaolin thought it was over, until she walked out of her apartment the afternoon of September 30 and saw Daniel standing outside. She messaged Zhang,</p><p>&ldquo;My nightmare is back again.&rdquo; </p><p>Cultural divide</p><p>Among Yaolin&rsquo;s close friends who knews bits about Daniel&rsquo;s absuive , Gloria was the only one who insisted on calling police.</p><p>After the night Daniel pushed her, she sat next to Yaolin on the stairs outside their apartment, insisting on calling the police.</p><p>Yaolin worried. &lsquo;What if the police don&rsquo;t do anything?&rsquo; Even if they arrest him, he would walk free after a couple of days. He&rsquo;s going to come back, and beat us up even worse. (NEEDS ATTRIBUTION) </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know about Daniel either, Yaolin said TO WHO?. She was ashamed by the fact that Daniel lived in her room, and she was being abused. She&rsquo;s afraid of people&rsquo;s judgment.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t live with someone like this, this is too terrifying,&rdquo; Gloria remembers telling Yaolin.   &ldquo;I did everything I could to make him move out,&rdquo; Yaolin told her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what else I can do.&rdquo; </p><p>insert the quote from study. later when we mention her roommate talked her out of calling police, intest, social support is really really important. when we talk about what Xu Gao said, that they didn&rsquo;t think it as abusive, &ldquo;that bad&rdquo; insert, how chinese people less likely to fewer Chinese students see abuse as a crime, Lin said, they are also less likely to call the police.  end with the quote of Gao, leaving a scar.</p><p>Nancy Stockton, director of IU&rsquo;s Counseling and Psychological Services, said victims of abuse not reaching out for help is an almost universal pattern across cultures.</p><p>&ldquo;The abuser&rsquo;s control over the woman is nearly absolute,&rdquo; Stockton said.</p><p>As is often the case when students die, several people came to CAPS seeking counseling for Yaolin&rsquo;s death. There is no Mandarin-speaking counselor at CAPS, though Stockton is actively seeking one. An after-hours contact number offers counseling in Mandarin.</p><p>Kai Lin, a researcher at the University of Delaware who has attended colleges both in China and the U.S., said there should be systems in place to offer support to international students from the moment they arrive on campus.</p><p>&ldquo;Having that kind of social support is very, very important,&rdquo; Lin said. </p><p>Lin was part of a team that published a study comparing American and Chinese students&rsquo; perceptions of intimate partner violence. One of the primary findings of the team&rsquo;s research was that Chinese students perceive fewer actions as abuse. </p><p>Because fewer Chinese students see abuse as a crime, Lin said, they are also less likely to call the police. The study Lin worked on stated that police in mainland China were less likely to intervene in cases of violence between couples.</p><p>&ldquo;... Many police officers regard [intimate partner violence] as private matters beyond police responsibilities and often refuse to accept or process victims&rsquo; complaints,&rdquo; the study reads. </p><p>Yaolin&rsquo;s father intends to set up a fund meant to educate Chinese students about resources available to them at American schools.</p><p>&ldquo;I regret it so much,&rdquo; Gloria said. &ldquo;If I called the police that night, this might never have happened.&rdquo;</p>
