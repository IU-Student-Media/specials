# ids-buildout-base
<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>This is a general template to publish long form articles at the Indiana Daily Student. If you have any questions, feel free to come talk to me at the IDS Mondays and Wednesday from 3 - 4 p.m. or email me at jabenedi@indiana.edu.</p>
<p>This template is adapted from <a href="http://specials.idsnews.com/caps/"> Waiting for Help</a> published in the Spring of 2015 at the <a href="http://www.idsnews.com">Indiana Daily Student</a>. It is being developed for stories from Bonnie Layton's multimedia section of the Words and Pictures course at IU in the Fall of 2015.</p>

<h2>Stories developed from this template</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://http://specials.idsnews.com/yaolin/">Friends regret not calling the police, describe a pattern of repeated abuse</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>This template was developed to provide a starting point for designers looking to publish their first responsive article. I tried to keep it simple and have it serve as a skeleton for your design. 
</p>

<p>Download the template folder from github. You can either download the folder as a zip or setup github and fork it. If you're confused about github and want to use it come into office hours.
</p>

<p>There will be a starter folder in the template. Pull it out of the template folder and rename it your story’s slug. Don't change the template folder’s files but keep it as a resource to copy paste from. If anything does break, you can always redownload the folder. The starter folder only has the basics in it to keep it light.
</p>

<p>Try to only work on a few things at a time and work on them until they are functional. Don't leave a bunch of half finished features you plan on finalizing later. Since this is a collaborative project make sure to comment your code well on anything you don’t think makes sense. 
</p>

<p>I normally start by placing my section heads and linking them into the nav bar. Then I move onto placing the first draft of the copy, before starting to layout the media. 
</p>

<p>The story’s structure will change around during the editing process so don't get too caught up on the exact layout of everything. Instead try to make sure everything is working and the in the right area (inline, sidebar or break). Also try to write in clear modules of code so it is easier to copy and paste in different parts of the article. I often have a comment before and after code modules that might switch around. Think about building with legos not bricks. 
</p>

<h1>Rules for Publish in the IDS</h1>

<p>Follow all commented instructions and call ids.css and ids.js last in your html. There is no absolute style rulebook, and we're open to changes as long as you have a compelling justification.
</p>

<p>Try to keep the digital desk updated on your story throughout your reporting and not just when you're ready to publish. You should start working with us directly three weeks before publication, I’ve included outline with deadlines for each week included in the next section. 
</p>

<p>The earlier we know how you're going to tell the story the better it will work online. I'm excited if you want a featured added so just let me know if you have any ideas. We will likely be debugging eight to ten stories at the end of the semester, so we need to already be familiar with your code and its issues before then.
</p>

<p>When you’re designing your story, keep all your files in your project folder. Story structures jump around, and photos get swapped out late so it is best to have everything in your folder even though it will be large. Still optimize your images for the web, don’t have duplicates, etc. but if there is a chance it will be needed in the final project keep it in. We will work to get your folder slim before publishing.
</p>

<p>We host everything on github, but if you're not comfortable working with it you can also just give us your code via email or a thumb drive. It can't include any server-side programming like Ruby, Python, PHP, etc. but I don't imagine you would ever need to. All project folders must be less than 80MB. There is a lot of extra javascript in the template folder as it shows you every option available. The starter folder is trimmed down so start working from there. 
</p>

<h3>File Optimization</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Save for web like Bonnie has taught (2x pixels you want with low compression rate) </li>
	<li>Before publishing, we will host the photos on our CMS’s photo server via gryphon. You need to work with an editor who has access to gryphon to upload your image. Try talking with James Benedict, Anna Boone, Bari Goldman, Katelyn Rowe or Rachel Meert to upload.</li>
	<li>Use recommended services to host other media</li>
	<li>More info to come</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended Services</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Youtube</li>
	<li>SoundCloud</li>
</ul>

<h1>Schedule and Deadlines</h1>

<p>Start working with our desk roughly three weeks before you want to publish. If you meet a deadline early you can move on to the next week.
</p>

<h4>Week 1</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Submit your article <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QeoXau5Ei1ZxBudCG72IKHDZvnaedjxyjayBAAHihCg/viewform">at this pitchlist</a> as other: buildout and include:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A working headline and slug. Both can change if needed, but the slug will show up in the URL so make sure it isn’t insensitive.</li>
			<li>A general list of the media you have (e.g. 2 maps, one chart, an audio slideshow and a couple photos).</li>
			<li>Contact info of everyone working on the story.</li>
			<li>When you want it to publish. If you’re unsure about the specific date, just put the Monday of the week you want to publish. </li>
		</ul>
	<li>Make sure you’re signed up for our <a href="https://jamesbenedict.slack.com/messages">slack account</a> so we can be in communication throughout the editing process.</li>
	<li>Come into an office hour (M/W 3-4 p.m.) or schedule a time to meet with me to discuss your story. Think of ideas you want to include in your story that you couldn’t figure out or any big challenges you’re nervous about. We will also go through how to get started with the folder. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 2</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Use the starter folder and copy-paste over examples from the template folder. If you run into issues getting things to work properly send us a message on slack. We might be able to identify the problem or send you a code snippet to fix it.</li>
	<li>Come into office hours or schedule a time to meet me to discuss more complicated problems.</li>
	<li>By the end of the week submit a first draft of your article. If you need / want to use lorem ipsum text that’s fine but have your media layed out in the correct hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 3</h4>
<p>We need a full week to edit your code, so make sure to submit a rough draft a five days before your publication date. Every day has specific deadlines this week. You can come into the IDS to work if you want hands on help, or can submit folders remotely. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Day 5
		<ul>
			<li>Tell us about major bugs or style problems you haven’t been able to figure out. </li>
			<li>Come in to receive an edited rough draft. You will receive two to do lists, one for bugs and other to make it comply with the ids style guide.</li>
			<li>Submit a final slug for use in the url of your website.</li>
			<li>Consider reaching out to experts or subjects in your story for promotion on social media. Tell them you plan to publish in a week and ask would they retweet or share your story on facebook. Try sharing your story in multiple niche circles where it will gain the best traction online. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Day 4
		<ul>
			<li>Update your style and submit a new version that complies with the ids style guide.</li>
			<li>Start debugging</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Day 3
		<ul>
			<li>More debugging</li>
			<li>Remove any features that still aren’t working by the end of the day.</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Day 2
		<ul>
			<li>Submit a debugged version. It should work on mobile, medium and large screens. If graphics or features aren’t working, they should be removed and a fully functional version submitted. If you are able to get them working before publication you can go back in and add it in, but we want a stable version that we know we can publish this day.</li>
			<li>Push your folder to our server so it is live. </li>
			<li>Make a list of problems discovered once the article went live. Normally these are small like a .js file being called in wrong, or an image being locally hosted somewhere outside the project folder.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Day 1 (night of production):
		<ul>
			<li>Place in copy edited copy and captions.</li>
			<li>Fix any issues found when the article went live.</li>
			<li>Possibly add in fixed features that were removed the day before.</li>
			<li>Prepare article for social media.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Day 0 (day is appears in the paper)
		<ul>
			<li>Sleep</li>
			<li>Try to be available to contact if other problems pop up or the story gains a lot of traction online.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
