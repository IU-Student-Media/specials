          Hidden away in the hallways of Fountain Square Mall in downtown
          Bloomington, Rewind Records is a treasure trove for music
          collectors. In a departure from traditional record stores, Rewind
          Records doesn’t sell new releases, instead hosting a bountiful
          collection of modern and vintage CDs and vinyls.

          Ashley Chandler owns Rewind Records with her husband, Wayne
          Chandler. She is a native of Brown County, Indiana, and has enjoyed
          collecting vinyl records and CDs since she was 11, when she stumbled
          upon her aunt’s old turntable at a yard sale. The discovery
          captivated her, and she has been collecting vinyls ever since.

          Ashley is someone with a true passion for music. Her hospitable
          demeanor toward the wandering music lover who enters Rewind Records
          gives the store a comfortable environment, a warm refuge from the
          grey drizzle of the Midwest winter season. Scored by the background
          music of a Bob Dylan CD, Ashley said she has always appreciated the
          reverberations and scratchy sounds of a vinyl spinning on a
          turntable. Through collecting records, she said that she felt safe
          and whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I like to collect things,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I like art, I like the
          tactile feeling of holding a record in my hands.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ashley said she is the kind of person who believes everything
          happens for a reason. She recalled a story when she was once selling
          T-shirts for a band gig when a girl complimented her stone necklace.
          As soon as the girl spoke, the necklace fell off, and Ashley took
          this as a sign that the girl was meant to have it and gave it to
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I think everything works out in the end,&rdquo; Ashley said, Dylan’s
          &ldquo;Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright&rdquo; filling the small space while she
          spoke.

            Ashley shows the inside artwork of Hole’s &ldquo;Pretty on the Inside&rdquo;
            CD on Jan. 30, 2025, at Rewind Records. She said she finds the
            designs on the inside of the album to be some of her favorite in
            the store’s collection.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A typical day in the store is relatively relaxed. Ashley mails
          packages, grades records based on their quality and organizes the
          store’s vast supply of CDs and vinyls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most customers browse with intention and know what they are looking
          for, but others seek Ashley’s guidance in finding a particular
          recording or album. When they do ask for help, Ashley said she
          enjoys connecting customers to whatever memory or feeling the music
          brings up for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          She said accessing these memories with them is her favorite part of
          her job. She said that music brings people together and is therefore
          essential in creating core memories.
        </p>

            A CD by the band Call It Arson is shown on Jan. 30, 2025, inside

            unique designs for these decorations.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>&ldquo;It brings up experiences for people,&rdquo; she said.</p>
        <p>
          She recalled once selling a Billy Joel record to a customer. He was
          looking for a particular record and was delighted when Ashley
          happened to have it, and she said the ensuing moment of bonding
          between the two left a lasting impression on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ashley said that while customers are usually first drawn to the shop
          by its selection of vintage and modern music, they return because of
          the personalized experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeremy Reed, a doctoral candidate at the IU Department of Folklore
          and Ethnomusicology, is a repeat customer of Rewind Records. While
          he appreciates the shop’s stock of music, he said talking with
          Ashley while browsing is a key part of his experience as a customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The conversations that I have with Ashley are meaningful,&rdquo; Reed
          said. &ldquo;I walk in with a list of things I might be searching for, and
          I always walk out with very pleasant surprises. Talking with Ashley
          is just a part of the experience.&rdquo;

          Rewind Records has been a concept since 2010, Ashley’s husband Wayne
          said. The business has explored several music and art related
          ventures over the years: recording music, teaching music lessons,
          designing screen-printed merch for bands, hosting musical
          rehearsals, signing artists to its record label and now selling
          records and CDs.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The record store is the first thing we’ve done that’s available to
          the general public,&rdquo; Wayne said. &ldquo;Anyone can shop here and buy
          records.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Rewind Records is a family endeavor as much as it is Wayne
          and Ashley’s. They said that they raise their two sons, who are 12
          and 8 years old, to embrace music and to work hard. That passion and
          care with which the shop is maintained is reflected in its cozy
          atmosphere. From Ashley’s hand-painted artworks on the wall to
          Wayne’s framed Steve Vai signature, the shop contains little bits of
          the owners throughout.
