				<p>There&rsquo;s a certain music to the IU women&rsquo;s wrestling club&rsquo;s practice: the shuffle of
					shoes against vinyl, the beat of panting breaths, the syncopation of grunts and lunges, the hum of a fan
					whirring in vain against Bloomington&rsquo;s late-summer heat.</p>
				<!-- TODO: Image here -->
	
				<p>Music, indeed. Circulating around the room, coach Erwin Salazar calls, &ldquo;Be purposeful, almost
					dance-like.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Today&rsquo;s mid-September practice, the first of the season, began with the team gathered in a circle.
					The athletes stretched on the red-and-yellow flooring of Bloomington High School North&rsquo;s gym while
					discussing what they learned in classes and debating their controversial pop culture takes.</p>
				<p>Club members arrived to a chorus of greetings and celebrations, whether the athlete had been attending
					practice for a year or was new to the mat.</p>
				<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to warm up. The athletes laugh and continue catching up as they jog easily around
					the perimeter of the room, then slowly traverse the floor, lunging to simulate a match, then resume
					jogging.</p>
				<p>It&rsquo;s not just the first practice of the year; it&rsquo;s a family reunion.</p>

				<p>Juniors Maggie Boncosky and Manroop Turna founded the club at the beginning of the 2024-25 academic year.
					Both wrestlers in high school, Boncosky and Turna found limited options for continuing their careers in
					college.</p>
	
				<p>&ldquo;Right now, as a woman, you have to choose between going to a big, academically rigorous
					university, or a much smaller, probably less prestigious school to wrestle,&rdquo; Boncosky said.
					&ldquo;We both chose to pursue education at a higher level but wanted to continue wrestling.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The popularity of women&rsquo;s wrestling is skyrocketing. In 2023 alone, the number of girls wrestling
					in high school rose by
					<a href="https://apnews.com/article/wrestling-girls-high-school-c1e18531cf36831e158282ea08ca9775"
						target="_blank">
						nearly 60%</a>
					from the previous year, after growing by five times over the previous decade. The Indiana High School
					Athletic Association sanctioned girls&rsquo; wrestling in
					<a href="https://www.themat.com/news/2024/april/29/indiana-becomes-46th-state-with-official-girls-state-championships-ihsaa-board-approves-full-recognition"

					the number of athletes dedicated to the sport having grown to the thousands. This past July,
					women&rsquo;s wrestling became an

				<p>Still, prejudices that wrestling is incompatible with conventional femininity or that women lack the
					temperament for the sport are prevalent. As a result, women&rsquo;s wrestling remains something of a
					fledgling sport,
					in terms of formal recognition. There are
					<a href="https://www.americanwomenswrestling.com/news-2/all-womens-college-wrestling-programs-mwsbn"
						target="_blank">
						only four</a> NCAA Division I varsity women&rsquo;s wrestling teams, in contrast to the
					<a href="https://www.ncsasports.org/mens-wrestling/division-1-colleges" target="_blank">
						78 Division I</a> varsity men&rsquo;s wrestling teams nationwide.
				</p>
				<p>Although IU&rsquo;s club is a dedicated space for female students to grow as wrestlers, it isn&rsquo;t
					open only to women. Around four men, a combination of IU students seeking to dip their toes into the
					sport for the first time and local high schoolers, participate in practice, too.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of unique challenges that come with being in this sport,&rdquo; Boncosky said.
					&ldquo;Everybody knows that being on a toxic team or being in a bad environment isn&rsquo;t an added
					challenge we need to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Boncosky came to the sport almost by chance. Bored after one of her high school volleyball seasons, she
					decided to sit in on a wrestling practice. She said the kindness of the community immediately grabbed
					her. This early exposure to a positive team environment remains central to Boncosky&rsquo;s continued
					career, as Salazar was her high school coach.</p>
				<p>Helping lead IU&rsquo;s club, Boncosky said, has been an opportunity to give back to the sport she loves.
				</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Wrestling gets under your skin; it gets in your blood,&rdquo; Boncosky said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
					know that anyone who&rsquo;s done this sport, competed in it and found family in it could go back to a
					life without it.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>A core principle of wrestling, a sport demanding aggression, is that what happens on the mat stays there.
					At the second of this week&rsquo;s practices, this agreement is on full display.</p>
				<p>This second practice is decidedly technical: club members learn about the minutiae of point scoring, the
					particulars of different moves, the principles of compromising an opponent. The team divides itself up
					to work on different maneuvers in pairs. Partners agree on whether they will assume an offensive or
					defensive position, then take to the mat.</p>
				<p>Learning moves must, at least initially, be approached academically. Partners talk through steps with
					each other, lunging, grabbing and turning slowly, methodically. When a step is forgotten, misplaced or
					approached improperly, they rewind to the last move that was made with certainty. Questions are a
					necessary part of the process.
					&ldquo;From this angle? With this arm? In this order?&rdquo;</p>
				<figure class="wide-right">
					<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/4b3496bb-a385-4a9e-89ce-9ed0a87c2a63.sized-1000x1000.jpg"

				</figure>
				<p>And, once on the mat, again and again: &ldquo;Are you okay? Do you need help?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>While practice is preparation for competition, teammates can never, ultimately, be adversaries. This is
					combat free from malice, learning free from judgment. Successful moves are met with smiles and claps on
					shoulders. Challenges are taken with resolve to be conquered collaboratively.</p>
				<p>After some time to practice independently, first-year member Eden Knight comes forward to demonstrate a
					newly-learned skill. Knight seizes her partner&rsquo;s legs, finds leverage under her ankles and begins
					to push. The gym erupts into cheers as Knight masters the freestyle wrestling leg lace in real time,
					turning her partner over a triumphant one, two, three, four times. When the maneuver is complete,
					Knight, panting, beams with pride.</p>
				<p>The only smile bigger than Knight&rsquo;s? Her partner&rsquo;s.</p>
				<p>Even as practice intensifies, the sport remains a family affair. But there&rsquo;s no lack of drive on
					the team, whose roster boasts state champion wrestlers and athletes who turned down Division II and III
					varsity offers.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Every athlete has that desire to compete,&rdquo; Turna, club co-founder and co-president, said.
					&ldquo;You go at it and just keep showing up, consistently.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>For a break from partner work, the whole team gathers inside a circle drawn around the center of the gym
					floor to play a game. Because wrestling matches take place within defined boundaries, forcing a partner
					beyond those lines is a critical method of scoring. The game&rsquo;s objective, then, is to be the last
					club member inside the circle.</p>
				<p>A frenzy of movement starts as soon as the game begins. Teammates lunge at one another, grappling until a
					betraying heel stumbles just outside of the circle&rsquo;s boundary, or taking opponents down and
					forcing them into compromised positions to force their concession. The last woman standing basks in a
					round of applause. Then, everyone returns to the circle for another round. It&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s
					game.</p>

				<p>Sophia Lancin has never been a stranger to competition. She was a
					<a href="https://www.usatkd.org/2023-events-junior-sparring-medalists" target="_blank">
						nationally ranked</a> Tae Kwon Do athlete for 10 years and a competitive cheerleader. So when she
					watched her brother start wrestling, she was immediately drawn to a new athletic outlet.
				</p>
	
				<p>&ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;why can&rsquo;t I do this?&rsquo;&rdquo; Lancin said.</p>
				<p>Lancin, a Connecticut native, went on to become one of the
					<a href="https://citylifestyle.com/articles/take-it-to-the-mat" target="_blank">
						most decorated</a> wrestlers in Weston High School&rsquo;s history, winning three All-State titles
					and two New England titles. Despite her success, Lancin said she faced condescension and judgment as the
					only girl on her team.
				</p>
				<p>Still, she remained convinced that a feminine wrestler was not an oxymoron. Now, at IU, Lancin feels
					she&rsquo;s finally been proven right.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;When me and the girls on the team step off the mat, we go out, do our makeup, do stereotypically
					feminine things,&rdquo; Lancin said. &ldquo;Just because we&rsquo;re in there working as hard as the
					guys doesn&rsquo;t make us any less of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>A far cry from her high school experience, the IU club&rsquo;s tightly-knit female community makes
					collegiate competition all the more invigorating for Lancin.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;When I came here, I was honestly scared: I&rsquo;d never really had a girls&rsquo; community to
					call my own,&rdquo; Lancin said. &ldquo;But this is a sisterhood. These are the best people I&rsquo;ve
					ever met in my life &mdash; I want to come to practice. I want to perform at game time.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>For all the empowerment and community, wrestling remains a high-risk activity. According to the National
					Library of Medicine, wrestling is considered one of the world&rsquo;s most physically-taxing sports,
					with an
					<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7972392/#b1-wjem-22-410" target="_blank">
						injury rate</a> second only to football. Instances of girls and women reporting serious
					wrestling-related injuries
					<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7972392/#b1-wjem-22-410" target="_blank">have
						grown</a> in recent years, corresponding to women&rsquo;s wrestling&rsquo;s surge in popularity.
				</p>
				<p>The prevalence of weight-cutting in wrestling amplifies the risks. Rapid weight cutting, undertaken to
					compete in lower weight classes, is associated with a
					<a href="https://www.med.wisc.edu/news/college-wrestling-injury-study/" target="_blank">
						higher likelihood of injury</a>. Extreme measures to cut weight can also make athletes vulnerable to
					<a href="https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/risk-groups/eating-disorder-athletes/wrestling-cutting-weight-bulimia"
						target="_blank">
						eating disorders</a>, which women already tend to be
					<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2696560/#R1" target="_blank">
						more susceptible
					</a>
					to than men.
				</p>
				<p>Turna said the club&rsquo;s efforts to provide high-quality coaching help protect against these risks.
				</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The moves are high-risk, but they&rsquo;ll only injure you if you do them wrong or if you push too
					hard,&rdquo; Turna said. &ldquo;As teammates, you shouldn&rsquo;t be pushing to that point.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Risk awareness is becoming more important in the broader wrestling community. Boncosky said responsible
					weight cutting was a main topic of a conference for Indiana high school wrestling coaches she attended
					in August. While extreme weight-cutting practices were once ubiquitous to the sport, the focus is
					shifting toward athlete safety, which sometimes means discouraging cutting weight altogether.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a brand-new wrestler, we tell her to wrestle the way she is, to not even try
					it,&rdquo; Boncosky said. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s an experienced wrestler, we trust that she knows what
					she&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The club&rsquo;s strong sense of community acts as a safety rail and support system away from
					wrestling&rsquo;s dangerous extremes. Here, the emphasis is on finding love of the sport and of the
					teammates by their side.</p>

				<p>The club&rsquo;s family environment is literal for freshmen Monica and Grace McMahon. Formally, the twins
					have been competing alongside each other since their sophomore year of high school, where they started
					the girls&rsquo; wrestling team at Columbus East High School. But coming from a family of nine siblings,
					the real training started sooner.</p>
	
				<p>&ldquo;We got a trampoline when we were little, and that&rsquo;s really where the first wrestling matches
					happened,&rdquo; Grace said.</p>
				<p>The McMahons were inspired to wrestle by their brothers taking up the sport and by a drive to hold their
					own in a competitive family. It was first at home, where showing up for their brothers&rsquo;
					tournaments was a priority, that Grace and Monica learned competition and support are not mutually
					exclusive.</p>
				<p>For Monica, relearning this lesson as an IU club member has proven to be an antidote to early college
					homesickness.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I had a rough start with conditioning, which is my worst nightmare,&rdquo; Monica said. &ldquo;But
					as we were going through the hardest part of it, the girls around me were so supportive. It healed a
					part of me &mdash; this team provides a home away from home.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>A nurturing team is all the more important in light of the psychological and athletic demands of
					wrestling. With those encouraging teammates, the McMahons said they have found empowerment in the sport.
				</p>
				<p>&ldquo;In this environment, it can really be, how can I, as an athlete &mdash; not based on my gender
					&mdash; push myself to the furthest?&rdquo; Monica said.</p>
				<p>For Grace, growth has meant learning when to stop pushing.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m competitive to the point where it&rsquo;s kind of unhealthy, so I&rsquo;ve set the
					boundary for myself that I&rsquo;m not going to compete in college,&rdquo; Grace said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
					here for pure love of the sport.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>This passion, and the family ties it engenders, are at the heart of wrestling.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You have to love each other to beat the crap out of each other,&rdquo; Monica said.</p>

				<p>By the end of practice, conversation fades. Movement looks slower, more laborious, after an hour and a
					half of scrimmaging and troubleshooting maneuvers. The evening practice, capping off a week of classes,
					has tapped into the end of teammates&rsquo; energy reserves.</p>
				<p>Cheeks are flushed, panting has crescendoed and the evening has grown tired. As the big blinking digital
					clock on the gym&rsquo;s right wall inches past 7:30 p.m., teammates start to trudge off the mat. They
					dab at the sweat condensing around their faces as they break for the mound of backpacks, water bottles
					and street shoes piled at the side of the gym.</p>
				<p>But even after 90 minutes of exertion and grappling, club members wear smiles. Conversation picks up
					again and the intense focus of competition and training relaxes back into camaraderie.</p>
				<p>Today&rsquo;s work is done. Now, it&rsquo;s time for a weekly team dinner. Everyone is invited.</p>
				<p>For the women&rsquo;s wrestling club, the family formed on the mat won&rsquo;t get left behind.</p>
