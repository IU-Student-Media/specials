				<p>Four bicycles whizzed around the track at Bill Armstrong Stadium. The stands were nearly empty, but around

				<p>Only a week and a half ago, senior Liam Collins biked 112 miles in five-and-a-half hours in the searing

				<p>Liam loves to suffer. He embraces it.</p>
				<p>When he&rsquo;s doing something difficult, he said his brain goes silent and into autopilot. He lets his body
					take over.</p>
				<p>After he ran a marathon the summer after his freshman year in 2023, he knew he would race an Ironman. The
					event takes contestants through 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles of biking and a marathon, totaling 140.6
					miles.</p>
				<p>He wanted to challenge himself, to test his limits, but it didn&rsquo;t cross his mind to do one so soon
					until he realized that it would be difficult to train for later in life with a full-time job and a family.
				</p>
				<p>Liam&rsquo;s dad, Darren Collins, said his son called him in March and told him he wanted to sign up for an
					Ironman in July.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty big deal,&rdquo; Darren remembered telling him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna need some
					time to train.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Darren told Liam he would cover the fees for an Ironman in Chattanooga. In March, while simultaneously
					training to compete for Alpha Kappa Lambda in the 2025 Little 500, Liam signed up for a full Ironman. Two
					days after the race, Liam started training for the Ironman.</p>
				<p>Its sign-up fees reached $950.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;These are wealthy people who do these things,&rdquo; Darren said. &ldquo;They have $20,000 bikes, they
					have trainers, they have tri suits, fancy shoes, fancy gear.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Liam used his $3,000 bike that he bought in his senior year of high school. He didn&rsquo;t have a coach and
					built his own training plan. His girlfriend of two years, IU senior Tori Donato, said he found all his
					training online.</p>

					<figcaption>

					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>&ldquo;He watched a bunch of videos,&rdquo; Donato said. &ldquo;He made all of his own plans, all of his
					nutrition plans. He had no coaching besides his own knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Over 40% of athletes in full and half Ironmans hire a coach or use a training plan, according to the Ironman
					website. The sweet spot for training is around nine months, but varies depending on experience.</p>
				<p>Liam trained for six months. He did so while interning in Atlanta over the summer, working 40 hours a week at
					SK Commercial Realty &mdash; a commercial real estate company.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be up at the ass-crack of dawn, early, get one workout and go to work,&rdquo; Liam said.
					&ldquo;Come back at four and then get another workout in.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He&rsquo;d run Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in the morning before the summer heat set in. He would swim
					Tuesday and Thursday mornings and bike in the afternoons, plus lift weights twice a week. On Saturdays, he
					woke up around 6 a.m. for more than 80 miles of biking. He exercised for around three hours, six days a
					week.</p>
				<p>Liam and his dad spent the summer in Atlanta together &mdash; just the two of them. Darren cooked for Liam,
					catering to his dietary needs for carb and protein-heavy meals to support his training.</p>
				<p>Donato said watching Liam prepare to compete motivated her, making her eventually want to do an Ironman
					herself. She&rsquo;s also a Little 500 rider, so they would sometimes train together on the bike.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If he was having a bad day, I&rsquo;d like, try to play a playlist on a ride, or make a joke,&rdquo;
					Donato said. &ldquo;It was certainly inspiring to watch someone deal with so many things, new priorities,
					and just get work done every day.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The first five or six weeks of training, Liam said, were the most difficult. His body wasn&rsquo;t accustomed
					to the training and stress because he had never pushed it so hard and long before. After around two months,
					he got into a rhythm and everything clicked.</p>
				<p>Since he swam in high school and for the IU club swimming team during his freshman and sophomore years
					&mdash; and trained for the Little 500 &mdash; Liam&rsquo;s goal for the Ironman was to finish in under 11
					hours. The average Ironman finish time for Liam&rsquo;s age group is around 12 and a half hours.</p>
				<p>Donato joined Liam and his parents in Chattanooga to support him during the race. The day before the race,
					Donato and Liam went to Rembrandt&rsquo;s Coffee House. Liam ordered a hot cappuccino and a chocolate
					croissant. Donato chose an iced vanilla latte and an almond cookie. Going to coffee shops is what they do
					when they&rsquo;re stressed, Donato said. Liam said it keeps him level-headed and gives him a sense of
					normalcy.</p>
				<p>The couple walked part of the course and the transition areas. Donato made sure he had food every second of
					the day to carb load. She hung balloons in Liam&rsquo;s room with pictures she took of him biking, running
					or photos she thought were silly. They were little snapshots that Donato used to try and remind Liam of all
					the progress that he had made. She wrote him a letter about how proud she was of him.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;This is how I see you training,&rsquo;&rdquo; Donato said. &ldquo;&rsquo;You work
					so hard and you don&rsquo;t see yourself this way. But I want you to see yourself this way.&rsquo;&rdquo;
				</p>

				<p>On the morning of Sept. 28, Liam and his family woke up at 4:30 a.m. He ate four eggs, two pieces of toast
					and drank a black cold brew coffee. Darren played Eminem&rsquo;s &ldquo;Without Me&rdquo; on the car ride to
					the race.</p>
				<p>Liam got to the transition point &mdash; a parking lot corralled into three different sections &mdash; to
					check in his bike. He then took a shuttle two and a half miles up the Tennessee River. He put his
					gray-and-red Indiana hoodie, shoes and socks in a bag, which was returned to the central common area for his
					next transition.</p>
				<p>There was a tracker around his ankle that connected to a mobile app Liam&rsquo;s family could use to see
					where he was on the track. Liam&rsquo;s 85-year-old grandmother, whom he calls &ldquo;Nana,&rdquo;
					downloaded the app on her iPad. His family was watching his progress from all over the country. His brother
					and brother&rsquo;s girlfriend watched from New York City, his cousin in Texas and his uncle in Kansas.</p>
				<p>Liam used an elastic band to stretch before the race and stay loose. Donato said she stepped back before the
					race to let Darren give him a pep talk.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It was kind of like, &lsquo;You got this, let&rsquo;s fucking go!&rsquo;&rdquo; Liam recalled Darren
					saying.</p>
				<p>Liam said Darren helped him the most out of anyone to prepare for the Ironman.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I just know there was a little moment there, because they had a hug,&rdquo; Donato said. &ldquo;And
					they don&rsquo;t hug a lot.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Then, it was just Liam, his pink swim cap and his goggles against 2.4 miles of open water. He was at the
					front of the start line, barefoot on a wobbly dock. Every three seconds, four people on the dock jumped into
					the water. Liam felt the dock shake every time. &ldquo;The water was the perfect temperature, Liam said: 76 degrees.&rdquo;</p>

					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>The beep sounded, and Liam jumped in. He said he blacked out and his body took over as he was just trying to
					get through each segment of the race. He could look up and see the bridges overhead and the required turns.
				</p>
				<p>He transitioned from the swim to the bike in six minutes. Liam raced loops on US-27. He counted the laps he
					had left on the bike. The bike course consisted of over 4,000 feet of elevation gain.</p>
				<p>After a 46-minute swim and a five-and-a-half-hour bike ride, only a marathon separated Liam from the finish
					line.</p>
				<p>Darren was concerned about Liam finishing, but he saw him during the transition.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We saw him on the bike, &lsquo;Dude, he's ripping it up on the road,&rsquo;&rdquo; Darren said.
					&ldquo;And then was like, &lsquo;Can he do the run?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
				<p>For Liam, the run was the most daunting part. It&rsquo;s what the race would come down to.</p>
				<p>Liam's skin was blistered and reddened from the unrelenting sun. Salt, leftover from dried sweat, crusted the
					underarms of his black and gray tri-suit. He didn&rsquo;t carry headphones, his phone or a water bottle.</p>
				<p>Liam dismounted his bike &mdash; a road bike with aero handlebars that he uses to train for the Little 500
					&mdash; and traded it for his run bag. He changed into his Nike Alpha Fly 3 running shoes, switched out his
					socks and grabbed his navy hat. The front of it, printed proudly in white-and-red lettering, read
					&ldquo;Ironman.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He still had 26.2 miles to run.</p>

				<p>Aid stations were scattered about every mile and a half along the course. Liam got his energy from gels,
					electrolytes, protein drinks and four granola bars. He put ice from the aid stations in his hat to stay
					cool.</p>
				<p>The last few miles were brutal in the 85-degree heat. Darren said some marathoners called the marathon a
					20-mile warmup and a six-mile race.</p>

					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>Liam knew on the bike that he would reach his goal of finishing in under 11 hours if he didn&rsquo;t lag
					behind during the marathon. By the first loop Liam ran, Darren was sure his son would finish. The tracker
					told the story.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;Look, he&rsquo;s got this thing,&rsquo;&rdquo; Darren said. &ldquo;&lsquo;I think
					this is pretty much in the bag.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
				<p>At 10 hours, 40 minutes and six seconds, Liam crossed the finish line fourth of 48 in the 18-24 age group and
					162nd overall out of over 1500 competitors.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The first thing I asked, like &lsquo;Where can I sit?&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then I walked out,
					and then laid on the grass, and you could see the sweat and shit all over me. Kind of gross.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He stayed on the ground for around five minutes. When he finally got up, his mom was worried about him
					collapsing. She held onto him to make sure he didn&rsquo;t fall.</p>
				<p>Darren said despite Liam being unable to walk, he looked happy. He hobbled back to the car.</p>
				<p>Liam got a greasy burger with bacon, tomato and pickles after the race with his family and Donato at the
					Tremont Tavern in Chattanooga. He slept for eight hours, but sunburn made it difficult for him to sleep. He
					had to stay in one position. In the days after, his legs were so sore he had to skateboard and take the bus
					to class.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I knew I would finish,&rdquo; Liam said. &ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo;</p>
