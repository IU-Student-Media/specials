                <p>The word mascot comes from the French word &ldquo;mascotte,&rdquo; which translates roughly to
                    &ldquo;lucky charm.&rdquo; In America, the term has become synonymous with people dressing up in
                    cartoonish costumes and strutting about a large green field. It&rsquo;s a ritual I know all too
                    well.</p>
                <p>Two summers ago, I worked for a collegiate league baseball team &mdash; the Minot Hot Tots &mdash; in
                    the middle of nowhere, North Dakota. Unbeknownst to me when I applied, one of my responsibilities
                    would be attending events as the team&rsquo;s mascot. And so, to my dismay, I dressed up as
                    everyone&rsquo;s favorite flaming tater tot &mdash; Tate R. Tot.</p>
                <p>While the experience zapped away every ounce of my dignity, it also made me a mascot connoisseur.
                    Therefore, no one is more qualified than me to accurately rank each Big Ten mascot.</p>
                <p>In order to protect myself from any distasteful comments stemming from such a polarizing topic, I
                    will &mdash; just this once &mdash; set my journalistic integrity aside. This article is completely
                    biased and wholeheartedly partial.</p>
                <p>With that being said, here is the definitive ranking of every mascot in the Big Ten Conference:</p>

                <h3>No mascots</h3>
                <p>The only schools in the conference without official mascots are Michigan and Illinois. In 1927, the
                    Wolverines experimented with, well, wolverines. Fielding H. Yost, the university&rsquo;s athletic
                    director at the time,
                    <a href="https://alumni.umich.edu/michigan-alum/history-lessons-u-ms-trouble-with-mascots/"
                        target="_blank">


                        struck a deal</a> with the Detroit Zoo to acquire a pair. Their names were Biff
                    and Bennie, and &mdash; after behavioral issues &mdash; they were promptly removed from the
                    sidelines.
                </p>
                <p>For 81 years, Illinois&rsquo; mascot was Chief Illiniwek. After controversy regarding the depiction
                    of a Native American character as a form of cultural appropriation, the school
                    <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/board-takes-final-vote-retires-chief-illiniwek/" target="_blank">
                        retired the mascot</a> in
                    2007 and hasn't adopted another one since.
                </p>
                <p>Both mascot-less programs will understandably be left out of my rankings.</p>

                    <h3>16. Nittany Lion (Penn State)</h3>

                    </figure>
                    <p>I mean, just look at this villain. The Nittany Lion looks like a third grader&rsquo;s drawing
                        come to
                        life. Since when did Dollar General sell costumes? I find it hard to believe that Penn State
                        fans
                        genuinely enjoy this mascot; it&rsquo;s not intimidating, not funny and, honestly, makes me a
                        wee
                        bit sad. Who thought it would be a good idea to dress him in just a scarf? No jersey, no pants,
                        nothing but a striped scarf.</p>

                    <h3>15. Purdue Pete (Purdue)</h3>
                    <figure class="mascot-img">
                        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/c01600f0-49f4-410e-90d4-1630a56d70cb.original.jpg"

                            <p class="credit">Tribune News Service</p>
                            <figcaption>Purdue Pete poses Aug. 15, 2022, along the sidelines at a football game. The mascot was first seen in 1940.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Yes, I attend Indiana University. No, that did not factor into this ranking. Human mascots,
                        generally
                        speaking, look silly. Purdue Pete is no different. I&rsquo;ll give him credit: the name&rsquo;s
                        catchy, and the hammer he carries is a nice touch. However, that face is nightmare fuel. His
                        lack of
                        expression gives him an eerie presence resembling that of a serial killer. I think if I stared
                        into
                        his eyes long enough, I would be forced to live the rest of my days shrouded in a cloud of
                        despair.
                        Before any Purdue alums try to nitpick, yes, I do know that the Boilermaker Special, a train, is
                        technically the school&rsquo;s official mascot. As much as I enjoy the occasional locomotive, I
                        refuse to rank an inanimate object alongside other mascots.</p>

In 1933, the university's athletic department released the first image of the mascot.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Unlike the last two, Willie&rsquo;s appearance doesn&rsquo;t make me want to avert my eyes in
                        disgust. That&rsquo;s a good start. However, he&rsquo;s kind of bland and has hair that
                        resembles
                        former U.S. President Martin Van Buren&rsquo;s. Additionally, he&rsquo;s not even the only
                        Wildcat
                        named Willie. Northwestern failed to copyright its initial Willie the Wildcat logo after its
                        inception in the 1940s and &mdash; as a result &mdash; Kansas State University adapted it and
                        made
                        the same mascot. They&rsquo;re both ugly.</p>

                    <p>This is the first of four schools with multiple mascots. For the purposes of my rankings, they
                        will
                        be ranked together, a decision that takes chemistry into account.  Firstly, I&rsquo;m shocked
                        that
                        Joe Bruin was the best name the school could come up with. I understand these two are beloved on
                        the
                        UCLA campus but, to be honest, they aren&rsquo;t anything special. They&rsquo;re two bears
                        wearing
                        shirts. I will say, Joe and Josephine&rsquo;s romantic relationship offers a unique dynamic
                        compared
                        to other mascots on this list, but their compelling love story is not enough to move the needle
                        in
                        my rankings.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;m not ashamed to say it, Lil&rsquo; Red has a special place in my heart. His jolliness is
                        only rivaled by the mascot of casual dining tycoon Big Boy. Still, these two are incredibly
                        strange.
                        Herbie&rsquo;s mug is upsetting to say the least. His dimples are somehow inverted?
                        Additionally,
                        there&rsquo;s no world in which these two should be allowed in the same room. Unfortunately for
                        Nebraska, that&rsquo;s often the case. You may be noticing a trend at this point; human mascots
                        aren&rsquo;t easy to pull off.</p>

                    <p>Who would&rsquo;ve guessed? Another human mascot. Sir Henry isn&rsquo;t bad, but he isn&rsquo;t
                        great. I think Rutgers does a good job with accessories. He&rsquo;ll sometimes wield a sword, an
                        axe, a shield and even the occasional eye black for certain sporting events. However, the crux
                        of
                        human mascots is their expression. Sir Henry&rsquo;s grin looks forced. It&rsquo;s also
                        unsettling
                        when he&rsquo;s smiling while the Scarlet Knights lose 56-10 to Oregon. I didn&rsquo;t have to
                        go
                        there, but I did. I&rsquo;m sorry Sir Henry, please don&rsquo;t come after me.</p>

                        disappointed. My
                        biggest qualm is his proportions, which make him look awkward and wobbly. I&rsquo;ll hazard a
                        guess
                        that a strong gust of wind could push Bucky over. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still like the

                        I&rsquo;m a huge proponent of mascots with unique shirts that aren&rsquo;t simply jerseys
                        slapped on
                        their chest. The turtleneck is a nice touch, and the badger is an awesome concept.</p>

                        mascot in 1961 and since then, 10 different horses have filled the role. A live horse on a
                        football
                        field? It&rsquo;s the type of pompous showmanship that harkens back to the Colosseum of ancient

                        &mdash; fitting for a team that plays in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. I also don&rsquo;t
                        mind
                        Tommy Trojan, the alternate mascot used in place of Traveler at indoor events. He&rsquo;s
                        nowhere
                        near as interesting as an actual horse, but he&rsquo;s a mascot suitable for a gameday photo.

                        complaint with Goldy Gopher. His design is amazing. Maybe it's because of my affection for the

                        his ears, his tail, they all work. There&rsquo;s a reason Goldy has won the mascot category at

                        best in the Big Ten, but among the best of all mascot-kind. The Oregon Duck is an icon. His
                        playful
                        demeanor and immature antics have cemented him into the fabric of college football&rsquo;s

                        Even so, I have a few complaints. For one, he&rsquo;s just a copy of Donald Duck. If you

                        believe me, look it up. In 1973, Oregon reached a

                            formal agreement with Disney</a> to use the
                        character&rsquo;s likeness as its mascot. Secondly, he doesn&rsquo;t have a real name. While
                        &ldquo;Puddles&rdquo; is a nickname regularly attributed to the Oregon Duck, the school has
                        refuted
                        it as an official title on multiple occasions. Again, I appreciate the contributions this
                        web-footed
                        mascot has made for the world of costumed creatures, but the competition is elite at the top of
                        my
                        rankings.

                    <p>I was raised a Buckeye. There, I said it. My parents met in the Ohio State marching band, and a
                        family friend was Brutus for a short time period. I can give you my word: those facts
                        didn&rsquo;t
                        factor into this decision. Brutus is one of a kind. How on earth did a school whose team name is
                        a
                        tree nut manage to create one of the most personable and renowned mascots in the world? It seems
                        impossible, but that&rsquo;s exactly what Ohio State did. His scarlet and gray striped shirt is
                        perfect, the towel is a subtle but recognizable ode to the program&rsquo;s football prowess and
                        the
                        &ldquo;block O&rdquo; hat literally tops it all off. Thanks to Lee Corso and ESPN&rsquo;s
                        College
                        GameDay, Brutus is a college football legend. Still, I think there&rsquo;s one mascot in the Big
                        Ten
                        who&rsquo;s got him beat.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The first college football video game I owned was &ldquo;NCAA Football 09&rdquo; on the Nintendo
                        Wii.
                        To promote the series&rsquo; first release on the console, Electronic Arts &mdash; the
                        game&rsquo;s
                        developer &mdash; held a competition that allowed fans to vote which mascot would be featured on
                        the
                        cover. Sparty won. Every time I reached into the drawer to pull out the game, he was there,
                        looking
                        right back at me. Maybe that&rsquo;s it, maybe that&rsquo;s why I made this list in the first
                        place,
                        maybe that&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by mascots. Honestly, I
                        don&rsquo;t
                        know. What I do know is that Sparty is the best mascot in the Big Ten. He&rsquo;s everything you
                        could possibly want. He&rsquo;s larger than life, intimidating and has a great head-to-toe
                        costume.
                        When you think of Michigan State, you think of Sparty. Although others often say it, or I
                        suppose
                        act it out, only Sparty can live up to every mascot&rsquo;s favorite hand gesture &mdash; he's
                        number one.</p>
