                            Last spring, Jenni Nolan got a breast biopsy at IU Health Hospital North in Carmel, Indiana.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her physician gave her a mammogram and injected her breast with lidocaine, an anesthetic.
                            Then, the doctor removed a tissue sample and stuck a tiny implantable tissue marker at the
                            injection site to ensure future biopsies would draw from a different spot. The whole process
                            took 25 minutes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mammogram added $469 to Nolan’s bill. The tiny marker? $1,014.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final charge was $10,687.55.

                                Jenni Nolan's medical bill from IU Health for her breast biopsy totaled $10,687.55, more
                                than twice the amount she expected.

                            After her insurance company, Cigna, determined what it would cover, Nolan still had to pay
                            about $2,700 out of pocket.

                            Even with the newly required data, patients have little to no information about how
                            hospitals determine the cost of their health care or how much of what they pay ends up as
                            profit. The data IU Health released estimates how much procedures cost, but the actual bill
                            each patient receives could vary drastically.

                            Nolan is a Board Certified Patient Advocate who owns a <a
                                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenninolan/" target="_blank">small business</a> that
                            helps people deal with confusing or unaffordable medical bills. She spends her days
                            negotiating with insurers and hospitals to resolve billing errors, to appeal when insurance
                            companies won’t pay for agreed-upon procedures and to dispute high charges for her clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Based on her working knowledge of health care costs, Nolan expected her breast biopsy would
                            be expensive — maybe somewhere around $3,000. The actual bill, more than three times that,
                            was a shock.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After her procedure, Nolan investigated IU Health’s standard charge listing and its <a

                            In a statement to the IDS, IU Health said its price estimator tool provides “meaningful
                            estimates” to 90,000 patients a year. But neither the estimator tool nor the standard charge
                            listing would have helped Nolan — they both underestimated her final bill by about half.

                                Bloomington's price listing. Anthem is the <a
                                    href="https://hr.iu.edu/benefits/health_care.html" target="_blank">provider</a> for
                                IU employees. United and Humana are the largest two large-group insurers in Indiana.
                                Medicare is included because it is commonly used as the baseline for insurer-hospital
                                negotiations.

                            She decided to confront IU Health about her own high fees by writing a letter to the billing
                            department.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within a couple of weeks, IU Health agreed to write off about $2,100 from Nolan’s bill,
                            leaving her to pay $600 out of pocket for the procedure, the amount she’d requested.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “But the problem is most of the world doesn't know that they can do that,” Nolan said. “They
                            don't even know where to begin.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nolan works with clients across the country who need help dealing with similar billing
                            issues, including many who received care at IU Health hospitals. She estimated about
                            three-fourths of her clients have medical bills that are higher due to clerical errors. The
                            rest are trying to combat correct but unaffordable bills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nolan helps them apply for financial assistance that hospitals offer. If they don’t qualify,
                            she negotiates the balance with the billing department.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fact that Nolan’s job exists at all points to the increasingly complex, bureaucratic
                            nature of hospital billing. <a href="https://www.pacboard.org/" target="_blank">Patient

                            Nolan said she wishes the system could be remade from scratch, removing the bureaucratic
                            procedures that drive up bills.

                            provide care to patients while patients pay for that care. It's difficult for patients to

                        <p>
                            The health care system is the only economic market in the United States in which consumers
                            don’t know the cost of a service before they agree to pay for it, Seth Freedman, IU O'Neill
                            School
                            of Public and Environmental Affairs associate professor, said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Not only is the price hidden, but patients often don’t have a choice in whether they need to
                            get a procedure. If someone is having a heart attack, they likely aren’t going to consider
                            the cost of an ambulance before they call 911.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There have been multiple attempts to offer more price transparency in insurance networks in
                            the past decade or so, Freedman said. Some insurers have developed price tools that allow
                            patients to compare costs for certain procedures at in-network hospitals.

                                target="_blank">Trump-era executive order</a> required hospitals to publish a single
                            “charge” for each procedure, but these numbers did not reflect the actual cost, which varies
                            widely for different patients. Freedman said the 2021 rule is the first major public-facing
                            step toward hospital price transparency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Insurance companies and hospitals rarely conduct line-by-line negotiations for each
                            individual price, Freedman said. Instead, companies negotiate many procedures at once, often
                            based on Medicare costs, without knowing what their competitors are negotiating with the
                            same hospital system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, an insurance company might agree to pay 150% of what hospitals charge the
                            federal government for multiple procedures rather than negotiating prices for individual
                            ones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For insurance companies, the federal transparency rule may mean more bargaining power when
                            they negotiate with hospital networks — even if not every hospital network is complying.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Anthem might say, ‘Look, you're charging Cigna $1,000 less. I want to pay $1,000 less
                            also,’” Freedman said.

                            But Marty Wood, Insurance Institute of Indiana president, said he was skeptical the rule
                            would significantly affect prices or negotiations, since so many other factors affect the
                            yearly process of working out contracts.

                            Experts disagree about whether price transparency will cause prices to go up or down.
                            Typically, they expect transparency will force prices down, but that isn’t always the case.

                        <p>
                            “Under certain market conditions, transparency like this actually makes prices go up,”
                            Freedman said. “They can see what other hospitals are pricing and use that as sharing
                            information with each other to force prices up.”

                        <p>
                            Individual patients tend to be either unaware this information is available or unable to
                            sift through it on their own to shop around, Freedman said, which is another reason the
                            standard charge listings may not make much of a difference in prices or negotiations.

                            For some procedures at IU Health Bloomington, insurance prices are up to 61 times greater
                            than self-pay prices, according to the IDS’s data analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Freedman said it would be inaccurate to think of self-pay prices as the “true” price of a
                            procedure because they are based on hospitals’ expectations about how much people can pay.
                            This is meant to avoid fees associated with hiring collections agencies to chase down
                            patients who haven’t paid.

                            The biggest proportional difference in the dataset was the cost of surgically removing up to
                            15 skin tags with IUHPS Narrow Network insurance. A self-pay patient would pay $128.76 for
                            the procedure. But with that insurance, the hospital would charge a total bill of $7,857.91
                            — 61 times more expensive.

                            Insurance companies don’t always have an incentive to negotiate lower costs. More spending
                            on health care means more money for insurance companies. According to federal law, insurance
                            company profits can’t exceed a percentage of the amount they spend on care. Even though
                            insured patients aren’t paying the full rates, their costs still go up when their insurers
                            negotiate higher prices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Freedman said higher bills for insurance companies lead to higher patient costs, which could
                            mean more out of pocket costs, higher premiums, a higher deductible or higher copay rates.

                            hospital to boost costs for commercial insurers, which raises the copays and premiums

                            prices. Therefore, this data may not be useful for choosing insurance companies but instead
                            for decisions like determining where and when to get a procedure.

                            All of the data released in compliance with the price transparency law is for all health
                            insurance companies that have negotiated with IU Health. A hospital that is in network for
                            an insurance company has negotiated a price specific to that hospital system.

                            “From the customer’s perspective, it means that they can go to any hospital within their
                            network and it will be covered,” Freedman said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Patients who go out of network may not be covered at all and usually have to pay much higher
                            out of pocket costs than they would in network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The price data from IU Health comes with several caveats. It remains unclear to what extent
                            the prices listed on these disclosures reflect the actual amount individual patients are
                            being charged because individual cases of the same procedure can vary widely. The data also
                            does not include the cost of a procedure before profit, which is why the IDS is making
                            relative comparisons between insurance companies and self-pay rates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For more serious or expensive procedures, the uninsured patient would be paying dramatically
                            more out of pocket than an insured patient. An uninsured patient would also have less access
                            to preventative care and regular check-ups.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the dramatic difference between the negotiated prices with insurance companies and the
                            prices for uninsured patients drives up the cost of care for everyone, from insurers to
                            employers to patients.

                        <p>
                            While the price transparency data is a step toward consumer choice in the health care
                            system, Freedman said the 2021 rule will likely have more of an impact on negotiations
                            between hospitals and insurance companies than on actual patients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “From the customer's perspective, I think there's still a ways to go to educate and empower
                            people to use these kinds of data in their decision making,” Freedman said.
                        </p>

                            But the maximum fee the federal government is levying for noncompliance is $109,500 per
                            year, or $300 a day. Because of the high cost of assembling and publishing price
                            transparency data and the possibility it could lead to lower profits, the fees are <a

                                target="_blank">likely less expensive</a> than the cost of compliance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The federal government has not enforced these fees, instead opting to send out <a
                                href="https://www.bricker.com/insights-resources/publications/cms-begins-enforcement-of-hospital-price-transparency-rule"
                                target="_blank">warning letters</a>. It is unclear if and when enforcement of fines will
                            begin.

                        <p>
                            The price data doesn’t help patients reliably predict the cost of their care. It doesn’t
                            erase often cripplingly high medical bills that many Americans face. And it doesn’t give
                            people the ability to prevent those types of bills in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But it does reveal previously unknown disparities among what IU Health Bloomington charges
                            patients who have different insurance plans and no insurance at all. Freedman said this
                            might lead to prices changing in the future as insurance companies now have the tools to
                            negotiate competitively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “I don't know if, on average, they'll end up going up or down because of this, but it
                            definitely seems likely that they'll converge,” Freedman said.

                            In the meantime, Nolan recommends patients advocate for themselves if they’re hit with high
                            bills. Even just sending a letter could help reduce medical costs.
                        </p>

                            “Just pushing back when you see a ridiculous price, we do have some control here,” Nolan
                            said. “We’ve got to stop just going along with it.”

                                To report this story, the Indiana Daily Student analyzed the <a

                                    target="_blank">standard charge listing</a> for IU Health Bloomington. We used that
                                data to create columns indicating the raw difference between self-pay costs and each
                                insurance company’s negotiated costs, and another indicating how many times greater than
                                self-pay each cost is.
                            </p>
