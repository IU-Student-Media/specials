                <p>A few weeks after Hank Duncan began his job as the Bloomington Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator on
                    Oct. 31, 2022, he received an upsetting report at work. Just 200 feet from his house, there had been
                    a car crash involving a pedestrian.</p>
                <p>“It was catastrophic,” Duncan said. “Just thinking about the people who live there and the lack of
                    proper infrastructure to protect those people, it's sickening. Seeing that every day on my way home,
                    my way to work, I just think about that. It's truly awful.”</p>
                <p>The crash was particularly relevant to Duncan, who works with the Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety
                    Commission to improve pedestrian infrastructure in the city. But Duncan said traffic safety efforts
                    are inadequate to properly address crashes like the one that happened right by his house, both in
                    Bloomington and across the country.</p>
                <p>“It's such a big problem,” Duncan said. “There are people working on it, but it's not being worked on
                    quickly enough.”</p>

                <p>Severe car crashes, and especially those involving pedestrians or cyclists, have recently risen
                    nationally. In 2020, crash deaths spiked even as total crashes dropped due to COVID-19
                    lockdowns.

                <p>Bloomington has a wealth of passionate transportation advocates and dedicated city employees who
                    told
                    the IDS they are aware of and concerned by recent spikes in pedestrian crashes. But many of
                    them,
                    like Duncan, said things aren’t happening quickly enough as they deal with limited resources,
                    funding issues and resident opposition to traffic safety projects.</p>
                <p>“What do we prioritize?” Duncan said. “We only have enough funding for certain projects, so we
                    can't
                    fix everything all at once, and that hurts.”</p>

                <h3>Addressing severe crashes in Bloomington</h3>
                <p>Beth Rosenbarger, assistant director of the Bloomington Planning and Transportation Department,
                    said
                    she hopes the city will soon adopt a <a href="https://visionzeronetwork.org/" target="_blank">Vision
                        Zero</a> approach, which is a strategy to eliminate
                    severe car crashes that cause fatalities or serious injuries.</p>

                <p>“A lot of us on staff are very familiar with Vision Zero goals,” Rosenbarger said. “We want that
                    as a
                    goal. The question is, how do we set ourselves up to get there?”</p>
                <p>Rosenbarger said there are several approaches known to reduce harm from vehicle collisions that
                    could
                    be implemented in Bloomington. One is reducing speed, <a
                        href="https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa1304/Resources3/08%20-%20The%20Relation%20Between%20Speed%20and%20Crashes.pdf"
                        target="_blank">the largest predictor</a> of whether a crash

                    <p class="quote">We want (Vision Zero) as a

                <p>“Anywhere from 15 MPH to 25 MPH has great safety gains compared to 30, 35, 40,” she said.</p>
                <p>Reducing speeding goes beyond changing posted speed limits, Rosenbarger said. Instead, changing
                    how
                    roads are designed, such as by making them narrower by adding a protected bike lane, would
                    discourage speeding more effectively.</p>
                <p>“We can't control individuals, sometimes the person is going to speed in a situation that doesn't
                    even make sense,” she said. “What we can do is work to design streets where the overwhelming
                    majority of the time, people are driving at lower speeds and that results in greater probability
                    of
                    safety.”</p>

                <p>Rosenbarger also said Vision Zero requires a proactive approach, not just choosing new projects
                    as a

                <p>But Rosenbarger added that proactive projects can receive the most pushback from residents, as
                    some
                    have trouble understanding the rationale behind changing an intersection, because they don’t
                    have
                    the urban planning or engineering expertise of the city staff.</p>

                    <a href="https://bsquarebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/exec-summary-1.pdf"
                        target="_blank">found</a> that poorer areas were objectively in need of better sidewalks,
                    including some where residents
                    were walking on dirt next to a road to reach a bus stop. But these areas had not received
                    funding
                    from
                    the existing <a href="https://bloomington.in.gov/council/sidewalks" target="_blank">Sidewalk

                </p>
                <p>Stosberg said these disparities resulted from multiple factors including the number of complaints
                    filed to decide where to allocate resources. He said he also analyzed the city’s complaint
                    system
                    and noticed stark differences in complaints coming from different neighborhoods.</p>

                <p>He said some neighborhoods had an organized approach to get many people to complain about even
                    small
                    issues, while generally poorer neighborhoods rarely ever complained at public meetings, even if
                    they
                    had worse existing infrastructure.</p>
                <p>“I just think either they didn't have time because they were busy working, or they just didn't
                    think
                    the system was built to work for them,” Stosberg said. “Why complain if it wouldn't make a
                    difference?”</p>
                <p>In the year after his report came out, Stosberg worked with city employees in the Planning and
                    Transportation Department to provide more analysis and technical help to create a more
                    evidence-based approach to funding sidewalks that kept socioeconomic factors in mind.</p>
                <p>“Since then, the city staff resolved to use a more objective method,” Stosberg said.</p>

                        target="_blank">complaint-based urban planning</a>
                    often falls short of delivering equitable solutions for communities.</p>
                <p>“People with children, people with jobs that aren't nine to five, people who are serving
                    caretaking
                    responsibilities, that is a lot of time out of your schedule,” Rosenbarger said. “There’s a
                    large
                    equity issue in terms of people's time and ability to participate.”</p>
                <p>But Rosenbarger also pointed out that while data is an important tool to identify inequities,
                    it’s
                    only part of the story and can leave out important context.</p>
                <p>For example, she said county car crash data can be useful to identify areas that are unsafe for
                    cyclists by identifying intersections where past crashes happened. But she added that roads with
                    no
                    reported crashes could still need bike infrastructure, and they might not show up in the data
                    because cyclists already avoid them due to feeling unsafe.</p>
                <p>Rosenbarger said the city’s Transportation Plan serves as a guideline for which transportation
                    projects to prioritize. According to <a
                        href="https://bloomington.in.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/05.22.2019%20Transportation%20Plan%20Council%20Approved%20edits_0.pdf"
                        target="_blank">the plan</a>, city employees used technical metrics and
                    feedback
                    from residents and public officials collected over a series of public meetings to determine
                    which
                    projects to include, and the final version was approved by the city council in 2019.</p>

                    Commission.</p>
                <p>Andrew Cibor, Bloomington city engineer, was involved in the stop sign dispute. Cibor told the
                    IDS
                    that as a city official, he must balance both providing engineering expertise and fielding
                    community
                    concerns.</p>
                <p>“If somebody has a question or wants to meet or wants to share a concern, they have every right
                    to do
                    so, and they should be treated respectfully,” Cibor said.</p>
                <p>But he also said that dealing with complaints “also limits our ability as a professional staff to
                    be
                    more proactive.”</p>
                <h3>The role of county crash data in planning</h3>
                <p>Multiple city employees told the IDS they frequently refer to county crash data as part of their
                    jobs
                    in the Planning and Transportation Department. Despite its limitations, the crash data plays an
                    important role in providing insights on transportation issues in the area, they said.</p>
                <p>The <a
                        href="https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/traffic-data/resource/54c306a8-0d7d-4a33-b3c3-9afda12c856e">public
                        crash data</a> has many inconsistencies and is difficult to work with. To help Bloomington
                    residents view insights from the crash data and explore specific transportation issues in their
                    neighborhoods, the IDS has published an <a href="https://github.com/ids-digi/moco-crash-data"
                        target="_blank">analysis</a> and <a
                        href="https://specials.idsnews.com/car-crash-dashboard-monroe-county/"
                        target="_blank">interactive map</a> of all 20 years of
                    available
                    data.</p>
                <p>The public data posted on the Bloomington Open Data site does not include information about which
                    crashes involved pedestrians or cyclists, even though pedestrian fatalities are one of the
                    largest
                    concerns of transportation advocates nationally. This is because the public datasets are
                    compiled at
                    the state level, city officials said, and don’t automatically include fields showing whether
                    pedestrians or cyclists were involved.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of extracting pedestrian and cyclist data from the state’s crash reporting system
                    has
                    frustrated city officials, including transportation technician Mike Stewart, who described their
                    system as a black box. To make this data public, the IDS worked with city employees, including
                    Stewart, to add this information to the datasets and map.</p>
                <p>The IDS also put together a <a

                        dictionary</a> of all the crash data, which includes details on fields that are unclear or
                    might
                    have caveats that aren’t explained in the public data website.</p>
                <p>The code used <a href="https://github.com/ids-digi/moco-crash-data/tree/main/cleaning-workflow">to
                        clean</a> the public data, as well as <a
