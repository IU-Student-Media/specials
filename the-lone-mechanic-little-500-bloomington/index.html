                <p>Rookies stumble into the bike shop like babies, big white helmets strapped below their chins, cheeks
                    chapped red from the October cold.</p>
                <p>Some cling to the edges of the room. Others move around cautiously. They mutter to each other asking
                    what tire pressure they should fill their wheels to. Their friends respond, heads shaking &mdash;
                    clueless.</p>
                <p>But an older rider, the oldest in the room by some 49 years, takes pity on the rookies.</p>
                <p>In the middle of the Little 500 bike shop, Greg Souder cranes his neck over a road bike, spinning its
                    front tire to check the derailleur, ensuring the chain shifts gears properly. A chunk of dirt flies
                    off the spokes.</p>

                            Greg Souder takes a moment to watch his bikeshop buzz with activity before a race Oct. 15,
                            2024, at Bill Armstrong Stadium in Bloomington. He and the riders prepared for one of the
                            biggest races prior to the Little 500 in April, the Bloomington Classic.

                    </figure>
                </div>


                <p>The room smells like spray paint, a few of the riders smell like sweat. More experienced cyclists
                    grab what they need and wave hello to the man. The newer riders, though, are less certain. Until
                    recently some didn&rsquo;t even know the bike shop tucked away under the stands of the race track
                    existed.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be bashful if you need help!&rdquo; Greg yells out.</p>
                <p>Dozens of student riders whisk in and out in preparation of the day&rsquo;s race: the Bloomington
                    Classic. And a few dozen times, Greg will show them how to adjust their bike seats, inflate their
                    tires or tighten their chains.</p>
                <p>Hundreds of students attempt to compete in the race. About 264 riders on 66 teams race on 185
                    bicycles. And one lone mechanic is responsible for keeping every wheel turning.</p>
                <p>Of the thousands of fans who watch from the stands, most won&rsquo;t even see Greg. To those who do,
                    he is little more than a speck on the sidelines of the Little 500 racetrack.</p>
                <p>But to the college kids who wheel their bikes into his shop week after week, Greg is the reason the
                    race goes on.</p>

                <p class='section-break'>•••</p>


                <p>Greg didn&rsquo;t expect to get the job.</p>
                <p>When he came home from work mowing lawns for the city one evening in 2018, his wife Joie greeted him
                    with a hiring ad she&rsquo;d cut out of The Herald-Times. She said she found him the perfect job.
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d hire an old man,&rdquo; he said.</p>
                <p>The mechanics for previous races were typically in their early 20s, recent IU graduates who tended to
                    stick around only for a year or two. They weren&rsquo;t like Greg, 69, with a thick gray horseshoe
                    mustache, doctor-recommended compression socks, vintage cars and grandchildren.</p>
                <p>This spring will be his seventh year.</p>

                    Sept. 20, 2024, at the Wilcox House in Bloomington. Greg said he’s “mechanically inclined” and
                    his love for cars started at a young age.

                    Wilcox House in Bloomington. Riders wheeled their bikes up to Greg to ask for help adjusting
                    their seats or fixing their chains.
                    <strong>BOTTOM LEFT</strong> Greg concentrates on adjusting a bike chain that
                    had been making noise when the rider pedaled Sept. 20, 2024, at the Wilcox House in Bloomington.
                    Greg said he always makes sure to lubricate riders’ bike chains to keep them working
                    smoothly.

                    riders biked up to the trunk of his car to make tweaks to their bikes before the ride.

            <div class="story">
                <p>With that time has come wisdom. When the Little 500 arrives, and Greg parks himself along the
                    track with a storage container aptly labeled &ldquo;GREG&rsquo;S STUFF FOR RACE DAY,&rdquo;
                    he&rsquo;ll have thought of everything. He brings water bottles and bandaids, extra washers
                    because sometimes when the kids build their own bikes, they put the wrong kind on. In October,
                    he packed extra clothes in case anyone got cold.</p>
                <p>He learned to carry safety pins if riders forgot to attach their race numbers to their jerseys.
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;I was a Boy Scout,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And Boy Scouts are supposed to be
                    prepared.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>To Greg, working as the Little 500 mechanic is a dream job &mdash; far better than when he worked
                    on his father&rsquo;s farm, or in his brother&rsquo;s pizza shop, or as a trucker or a factory
                    worker or a tree stump grinder.</p>

                <p>He said he&rsquo;s always been &ldquo;mechanically inclined,&rdquo; ever since he was old enough
                    to reach the pedals on a tractor. When he was 16, he taught himself how to repair cars because
                    he didn&rsquo;t have the money to pay someone else to, and his penchant for street racing meant
                    his 1965 Chevelle Super Sport was often in need of TLC.</p>
                <p>He enjoys pushing the boundaries of his knowledge &mdash; unraveling greasy puzzles made of gears
                    and wires. He likes the satisfaction, the sense of accomplishment that comes with doing
                    something yourself.</p>
                <p>Greg didn&rsquo;t become interested in cycling until he was in his mid-50s, when a doctor told
                    him it would be better for his knees than running. He even owned a bike shop in Huntington,
                    Indiana, for a few months in 2012. When he accepted the Little 500 mechanic position, he assumed
                    he&rsquo;d be working alone on bicycle upkeep.</p>






                <p>&ldquo;I never dreamed that I would have such one-on-one conversations and things with the
                    students,&rdquo; Greg said. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a teaching aspect to it that I never
                    dreamed about, because these students are like sponges.&rdquo;</p>

                        the Wilcox House in Bloomington. Greg said he enjoys getting to know riders outside of the
                        Little 500.

                <p>Dorothy Curran-Muñoz joined the Little 500 her sophomore year. She was looking for somewhere that
                    made the campus of almost 50,000 students feel smaller. She was invited to start the
                    women&rsquo;s Novus team, but she knew nothing about racing. Dorothy didn&rsquo;t even have her
                    own bike to practice with outside of Little 500.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;So my mom found one for me on Facebook Marketplace for like 80 bucks,&rdquo; she said.
                    &ldquo;And it was totally only worth 80 bucks.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>When it wouldn&rsquo;t shift gears correctly, the men&rsquo;s Novus captain directed her to the
                    mechanic. Greg welcomed Dorothy, fixed her bike and showed her what the different parts were. He
                    opened the bike shop for her one day and spent an hour teaching her.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I remember walking away that day feeling such a sense of belonging that I hadn&rsquo;t
                    before,&rdquo; Dorothy said. &ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;Okay, maybe I can do this.&rsquo;&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>Now, Dorothy is a senior on the Riders Council. She says she often encourages rookies to go to
                    Greg for help because he never makes them feel out of place. Whenever she sends someone his way,
                    she makes sure to tell them to say thank you.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;You know when professors, like, you can just tell that they love what they&rsquo;re doing?
                    They love the content. They love teaching. They want you to understand,&rdquo; she said.
                    &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how Greg is about bikes.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Dorothy said Greg taught her everything she knows about bikes. When she walks into the shop the
                    day of the Bloomington Classic, he catches up with her and asks if she got a haircut.</p>


                <p>Other riders learned what they know from Greg, too. Owen Teed is a senior and President of Riders
                    Council. The Little 500 is in his blood &mdash; his dad raced for Human Wheels when he went to
                    IU, and his sister Abby raced for Melanzana.</p>

                        Owen Teed, President of the IU Student Foundation Riders Council, sits outside the Wilcox House
                        on Oct. 3, 2024, in Bloomington. Teed said he built his race team’s bicycles after learning
                        about bike maintenance from Greg.

                </figure>

                <p>During Welcome Week his freshman year, Owen&rsquo;s sister introduced him to Greg. The next year
                    when Owen started his own team &mdash; a revitalized Human Wheels &mdash; he went to Greg again.
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;He remembered my last name and I told him I was, in fact, Abby Teed&rsquo;s
                    brother,&rdquo; Owen said.</p>
                <p>The first few times Greg fixed his bike, Owen didn&rsquo;t watch carefully. But soon he realized
                    just how often they needed repairs.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;So the next time I took it to him, I paid close attention,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
                    everything I've had him do on my bike, I've paid close attention, to the point where last year I
                    built my team's race bikes.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Greg says it&rsquo;s harder for boys to ask him for help than girls. He thinks boys don&rsquo;t
                    want their teammates to think less of them. Owen says Greg told him the men&rsquo;s teams
                    don&rsquo;t take enough advantage of the skills he has to offer.</p>

                        Cyclocross Race on Nov. 11, 2024, at the IU tailgating fields in Bloomington. Greg attended
                        every race and training event leading up to the Little 500 in April. </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>But Owen is quick to say he&rsquo;s glad to learn from Greg.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;You can tell it kind of warms his heart a little bit to see that what he&rsquo;s taught
                    you has paid off, and you&rsquo;re now able to do it on your own,&rdquo; Owen said.</p>
                <p>To Greg, that&rsquo;s one of the best parts about the job. He loves watching students grow during
                    their time at IU &mdash; not just as riders or mechanics, but as adults.</p>
                <p>Just a few weeks before this year&rsquo;s Little 500, Greg told Owen it seemed like just
                    yesterday he walked into the bike shop as a freshman.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;And in four years just, poof,&rdquo; Greg said. &ldquo;Went by already.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Before the Bloomington Classic, Greg kneels down on the cement floor marked with tire prints to
                    show a girl how to pump air into her tire.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;In a couple of years,&rdquo; he says to the rookie, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be captain of the
                    team.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class='section-break'>•••</p>
                <p>When Greg and his wife moved to Bloomington in 2017 from Markle, Indiana, they didn&rsquo;t know
                    many people in town.</p>
                <p>Then in December 2021, Greg found out he had a tumor on his kidney.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;When you go to a doctor and that doctor mentions the C-word &mdash;&rdquo; he says. His
                    voice trails off. &ldquo;My mind just went fuzzy.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>He&rsquo;d never received a diagnosis like it. He&rsquo;d never even broken a bone, spare a few
                    fingers he smashed working in a factory.</p>
                <p>Cancer changed things for Greg. He could no longer ride his bike for miles every day. He could no
                    longer move as freely. But more than that, it changed how Greg thought. It lingered in the back
                    of his mind no matter what he was doing. He had a granddaughter and a grandson on the way. Joie
                    had health problems too, and he wanted to take care of her.</p>

                        Bloomington. Norah, 8, carried her favorite stuffed animal, Pete the Cat, while she followed
                        Greg around his garage.

                </figure>
                <p>&ldquo;I just kept thinking, &lsquo;Man, I want to be here for them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
                <p>On Valentine&rsquo;s Day 2022, he had his kidney removed, but the cancer had spread to his
                    bladder. He had to undergo immunotherapy treatments for the next two and a half years. Being
                    away from home made it more difficult.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really hard when you move across the state and move away from all your family and
                    friends, or most of them,&rdquo; Greg said. &ldquo;At my age, it's hard to make close
                    friends.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The support he found at the Little 500, though, from the race director and the students and
                    office staff, meant everything to him. His bosses let him keep his job and take time off. They
                    brought in another mechanic to help him. Calls and texts poured in from people wishing him well.

                        bike rides around Bloomington. He now keeps the photo stored away with cards gifted to him from
                        riders. </figcaption>

                <p>&ldquo;It just made me realize this is where I belonged,&rdquo; he said.</p>
                <p>That&rsquo;s why he was back working the race that April 1, less than two months after having his
                    kidney removed. He loves this job, he says.</p>
                <p>Today, Greg is healthy. But even now, he chooses not to use the word &ldquo;cancer-free.&rdquo;
                    He says he&rsquo;s lucky he didn&rsquo;t have to go through chemo, lucky that life is good.
                    Still, when he goes in for scopes and scans, he holds his breath and hopes they don&rsquo;t find
                    anything.</p>
                <p>Tucked away on a shelf in his garage at home, wrapped safely in a plastic baggie, he stores the
                    cards riders wrote to him when he was sick.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Kept every one of them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
                <p class='section-break'>•••</p>
                <p>As the spring approaches, Greg stays at Bill Armstrong Stadium later and later, often past 9:45
                    p.m. when the racetrack closes.</p>
                <p>He can feel the anticipation building. He sees teams glide around the track in packs, day after
                    day until the end of April. All the riders are nervous, he says, every single one of them.</p>
                <p>He tells them to have fun. Enjoy the moment.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s usually the last words &mdash;
                    &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
                <p>He stands at the track, watching as kids lap him. A rider calls out to him from her bike, and
                    then she&rsquo;s gone. She zips past before he can recognize who it is.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;That happens all the time,&rdquo; he says.</p>
                <p>The anxiety leading up to the race doesn&rsquo;t get to him anymore, not like it did the first
                    year or two. He doesn&rsquo;t take any stress home from work. Joie said he can fall asleep at
                    the drop of a hat.</p>

                <p>At home Greg&rsquo;s garage is pristine. Every tool is hung just so, his dog Kylo is sprawled in
                    front of the hood of his prized possession, a sparkly blue 1963 Mercury Meteor. His grandson
                    Lewis and granddaughter Norah love riding in its rear-facing back seat. Norah is 8 and chatty
                    and orbits Greg like he&rsquo;s the sun.</p>
                <p>He could stay at home, relaxed and retired. But he chooses to be the lone mechanic.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Before I was trying to make money doing everything, you know? When your kids are young,
                    that's your focus, especially as a man providing for your family,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And I
                    don't have to do that anymore. So I think that makes it more enjoyable that I don't have to do
                    this.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>For now, Greg has no plans to retire. When he does, he thinks they should replace him with
                    another &ldquo;older gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I know the end will come someday, and I just sincerely hope that the IUSF can find
                    somebody that loves this job as much as I do,&rdquo; he says.</p>
                <p>He waits in the bike shop. Even though it&rsquo;s cold he leaves the door propped open for kids
                    to come in. On the workbench, he&rsquo;s framed a photo of him and some riders, all of whom are
                    long graduated.</p>
                <p>Soon, he&rsquo;ll be done too.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping if I make it 10 years,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll name
                    the bike shop after me.&rdquo;</p>
