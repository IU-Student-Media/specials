				<p>Joe McWhorter Sr., 78, used to burn houses down to pass the time on Saturdays.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one way we were able to show somebody what fire was actually like,&rdquo; he said.
					&ldquo;Put
					them in a house that&rsquo;s actually on fire. You&rsquo;re talking about 800 degrees coming down on
					your
					head.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>McWhorter has been working as a volunteer firefighter with the Monroe Fire Protection District since
					1969. Simulated
					fires were one of the protection district&rsquo;s methods of training volunteers 56 years ago.</p>

				<p>Now, amid a nationwide volunteer firefighter shortage, recruiting and training isn&rsquo;t that simple.
					According to
					the National Fire Protection Association, the number of volunteer firefighters in the U.S. is the <a
						href="https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/us-fire-department-profile">lowest
						it has been</a>
					since they started collecting data in 1986.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big commitment to be a volunteer, to go on the training,&rdquo; McWhorter said.
					&ldquo;I
					don&rsquo;t think the general public realizes that to be a volunteer firefighter, you have to go through
					all that
					same training as well.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>In Indiana, 80% of first responders are volunteers, according to the MFD. The <a
						href="https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/registry/summary">Federal Emergency
						Management Agency</a>
					says more than 70% of fire departments in Indiana are exclusively manned by volunteers.</p>


				<p>That means when a shiny, red truck barrels past you, and the doppler effect of the siren shrieks away in
					your ears,
					there&rsquo;s a high chance the people running toward the danger are doing it for free.</p>
				<p>Volunteers don&rsquo;t make a salary. While employed firefighters have health insurance, only
					government-issued
					workers&rsquo; compensation covers if a volunteer gets hurt.</p>

				<p>They also get a <a
						href="https://www.in.gov/sboa/files/Fire-Protection-State-Called-Meetings-2023.pdf">yearly</a>
					clothes and car allowance from whichever township the department services. That totals a
					minimum of $200 per department.</p>


				<iframe title="Zip codes covered by Monroe Fire Protection District" aria-label="Map"
					id="datawrapper-chart-XRL4C" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XRL4C/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
					style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="775" data-external="1"></iframe>
				<script type="text/javascript">!function () { "use strict"; window.addEventListener("message", (function (a) { if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var e = document.querySelectorAll("iframe"); for (var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) for (var r, i = 0; r = e[i]; i++)if (r.contentWindow === a.source) { var d = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px"; r.style.height = d } } })) }();

				</script>


				<p>With what little funding the department receives, McWhorter said, training new volunteers is notably
					expensive.
					Recruits typically move on after they have enough hours to get a career firefighter position.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;A lot of the guys are here now for the employment,&rdquo; McWhorter said. &ldquo;You come in as a
					volunteer,
					you work your way to employment. If there&rsquo;s an opening, you qualify, you go in.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>This is especially true amid a perpetual salary war between Bloomington Fire Department, an entirely
					career
					department, and the MFD, a combination of volunteer and career firefighters.</p>


				<p>Last year, the Bloomington City Council unanimously approved <a
						href="https://bloomington.in.gov/council/legislation/Ordinance/2024/2024-19">an ordinance</a> that
					gave BFD firefighters a 35% raise to
					$78,503 for this year. The city <a
						href="https://bsquarebulletin.com/salary-notebook-bloomington-police-officers-firefighters-up-for-big-increases-in-2025/#:~:text=For%20their%20base%20salary%2C%20Bloomington,the%202025%20figure%2C%20to%20%2483%2C503.">raised
						firefighter pay</a> to improve retention and get ahead of the county&rsquo;s pay
					for career firefighters, which stood at $72,820.</p>


				<p>The BFD also reopened its <a
						href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2024/10/bloomington-fire-station-reopening-renovation">primary
						station</a> in October last year after a three-year, $4.5 million renovation.
					MFD&rsquo;s headquarters, Station 22, in contrast, is an old house that used to belong to school bus
					drivers on
					South Kennedy Drive –– that&rsquo;s why McWhorter said there&rsquo;s room for the rigs.</p>



				<p>McWhorter pointed out the difference in who joined the volunteer force between 1969 and now.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder because back when we started, it was mainly taxpayers in the area that wanted to
					help out
					the community, whereas now it&rsquo;s young kids looking for a career starting out at $60,000, $70,000
					at 18,&rdquo;
					McWhorter said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &mdash; it&rsquo;s something else. Makes you want to be a young kid and
					fight
					fire.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>His grandson, Robert McWhorter Jr., is a fire captain at BFD.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing good up there,&rdquo; McWhorter Sr. said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him down
					here. Things
					didn&rsquo;t work out that way, but there&rsquo;s another generation going on up at the city, so.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>Enrollment in volunteer firefighting programs has plummeted in recent years, according to Jack Kerney,
					past president
					of the Indiana Volunteer Firefighter Association.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Twenty to 30 years ago, our membership was 18,000 or 19,000, and now it's down to 12 or
					13,000,&rdquo; Kerney
					said during an IVFA meeting in February last year. &ldquo;So we've lost about a third, but that's not
					just Indiana.
					It's all across the country.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>A volunteer needs a day job. With no pay, they rely on different ways to support themselves and their
					families. They
					put out fires, but they also tend the cornfields that swath over the state or drive 18-wheelers across
					the country.
				</p>
				<p>Career-aged volunteers aren&rsquo;t available during the day, which is why young volunteers are so
					crucial. But they
					keep leaving.</p>

				<p>Mary Nancy Mwakalindile, an MFD volunteer, is afraid of fire.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If somebody was stuck in a fire, I would run screaming all the way in and all the way out,&rdquo;
					she said.
					&ldquo;I think there are braver people doing it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Mwakalindile is a certified EMT. She graduated IU in December last year with a master&rsquo;s degree in
					information
					systems after getting her bachelor&rsquo;s in cognitive science in 2023.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I got my EMT certificate in a gap year after high school,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted to use it
					somehow.&rdquo;

				</figure>

				<p>She grew up down the street from Station 22. On her first day of school, she missed the bus, and the
					station was her
					reference point to get back home.</p>
				<p>Though she&rsquo;s not fighting fire, she&rsquo;s putting her skills to use. She helps the MFD teach fire
					prevention
					at schools during events called touch-a-truck. And while most young volunteers are out the door after
					finding
					long-term employment, that&rsquo;s not how Mwakalindile thinks about it.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m in Monroe County, I&rsquo;ll be here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>Mwakalindile not only volunteers as an EMT, but she also worked as an IT intern at MFD. She redesigned
					the
					department&rsquo;s website.</p>
				<p>The IU graduate said working as a first responder to fires has taught her how to recognize and treat
					fire-related
					injuries.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There are things they see on fire patients that I would not even consider,&rdquo; Mwakalindile
					said. &ldquo;So
					you learn a lot of knowledge from that. I&rsquo;ve learned so much about fire that I didn&rsquo;t think
					I would need
					to know. So many ways I&rsquo;ve not burnt down my house.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She&rsquo;s now comfortable enough with the fire station to where it&rsquo;s become a second home for
					her. When she
					calls her mom before her shift, she tells her she&rsquo;s going to hang out at the fire station.</p>
				<p>Station 22 is cozy. The garage&rsquo;s gray ceilings are low. Jason Allen, MFD battalion chief,
					apologizes repeatedly
					for dirty floors and stray pairs of shoes.</p>

				<p>There is a sense of pride in this place.</p>
				<p>For the firefighters to spend hours upon hours at the station, it should feel like a home. And it does.
				</p>
				<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a second home for Leigh Dillard. She&rsquo;s a member of the auxiliary, a group of
					volunteers
					that don&rsquo;t fight fires or provide first responder services. Her husband is Dustin Dillard, fire
					chief of MFD.
				</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If the guys are on the scene for a long time, we'll bring food or water or drinks,&rdquo; Leigh
					said.</p>
				<p>Leigh said MFD&rsquo;s favorite on-scene snack is McDonald&rsquo;s. She has a recurring mass order on the
					app.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot of sandwiches,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>Leigh and Dustin have four kids: one son and three daughters. Their second-oldest, Annleigh, wants to be
					a fire chief
					like her dad when she grows up.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a unique family,&rdquo; Leigh said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s special, something that not a lot
					of people
					know until they&rsquo;re in it. I always try to explain it, but you just kind of have to know.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>Though Leigh isn&rsquo;t trained as a first responder, the services she provides as an auxiliary
					volunteer help the
					department stay afloat. She&rsquo;s a licensed teacher in Indiana, so she writes the lesson plans for
					the fire
					prevention classes the MFD teaches in schools.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You can volunteer in so many ways,&rdquo; Leigh said. &ldquo;You can be a huge help, even if you
					can&rsquo;t
					go out and fight the fires or have the training, there&rsquo;s always somewhere, some place for
					you.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The volunteer shortage isn&rsquo;t limited to Monroe County. It&rsquo;s statewide, and it hurts rural
					areas in
					particular.</p>
				<p>According to the NFPA, 95% of volunteer firefighters serve departments that protect fewer than 25,000
					people. Though
					they provide for less people, they cover the most land.</p>
				<p>The demand for service is &ldquo;huge,&rdquo; State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said at an Indiana Volunteer
					Firefighters Association meeting last year, and most of it falls on volunteers because they cover most
					of Indiana.
				</p>
				
				<p>Allen relayed a similar sentiment at MFD over a year later. He added that many rural communities
					don&rsquo;t have
					enough money to fund a career department fully.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Most of them find the only feasible way economically is to create their own volunteer fire
					department,
					purchase some used equipment, a firehouse and rely on community members to staff those when a call comes
					out,&rdquo;
					Allen said.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>MFD Fire Chief Dillard said that kind of system relied on volunteers&rsquo; daytime employers being
					flexible with the
					volunteers&rsquo; hours.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Traditionally, in the past, in a lot of rural Indiana, employers would allow people in the
					community to leave
					work to respond on calls because that employer also relied on emergency service,&rdquo; Dillard said.
				</p>
				<p>Since that social covenant has expired, new volunteers have to complete their training hours during
