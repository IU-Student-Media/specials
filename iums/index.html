He appeared in seven matches his freshman season, but had to redshirt his sophomore year due to injury. Last season, Kleyn played 14 games and started six while still battling injury. He recorded four shots, with two being on goal, but made contributions on the defensive end — helping Muse shutout 18 teams and allow only seven goals. If Kleyn can stay injury free, the Hoosiers will have a strong asset in the backline. </p>

Ranked as a three-star recruit by Top Drawer Soccer, Meier was ranked as the No. 4 player in the Midwest region and No. 24 defender in the country. In his four years with the Minnesota Thunder Academy, Meier started every minute of every match and was a team captain all four years. As he gets more comfortable within Coach Yeagley’s system, the defender could help the Hoosiers’ stingy defense.</p>

In 2016 with the Hoosiers, Palazzolo appeared in 10 matches off the bench and recorded two assists. One of his assists came in the Big Ten Tournament semifinal against Wisconsin, when IU was down 1-0, to tie up the game. Being eligible again this season, he can prove effective as another valuable substitute off the bench.</p>

From coming off the bench in six games his first season, to playing in 17 — starting 10 — his second season, to then starting all 25 games in IU’s title-match run a year ago. He found the net three times last year to go along with one assist and a total of seven points. Entering his senior season, the 6-foot-1 defender would want nothing more than to lead his team to the championship, something IU came so close to capturing a year ago.</p>

He also played tournaments in Slovakia, Portugal and the Czech Republic with the U.S. Under-18 National Team, helping the team win the International Vaclav Jezek tournament in the Czech Republic.

He was named Second-Team All-Big Ten in his first two years after having one goal and at least one assist both seasons. However, last season the defender found the net seven times and racked up four assists to give him First-Team All-Big Ten honors. His aggressiveness on the attack and solid defending make him one of IU’s most complete players. Expect his senior year to replicate much of his first three seasons. </p>

In 2017, the Hoosiers led the NCAA in shutouts with 18 and goals allowed with 7, as Buckmaster started in 23 games in the midfield. He has only scored a single goal in his career, which came all the way back in his freshman season, but in 201, he was tied for second on the team with six assists. Buckmaster’s defensive ability is something IU will rely on heavily this season. In his senior season, Buckmaster will play a pivotal role for the Hoosiers once again on the defensive side of the ball.</p>

His team-leading eight assists and 16 total points helped the Hoosiers put points on the board en route to their 18-1-6 record. He scored four goals last season to give him 11 for his IU career. He also has 11 career assists. IU will benefit from having Swartz in the middle of the field for one last season. With the taste of a championship on the tip of his tongue, expect Swartz to do much of the same this year in hopes of claiming the big prize.</p>

His highlight of the year came against Ohio State in the Big Ten Tournament semifinals, when he assisted IU’s fourth and final goal to shutout the Buckeyes 4-0. Barring injury, Rennicks can be a solid substitute to either help control the tempo in the midfield, or be a threat at the striker position.</p>

He netted seven goals, including three game-winners, had three assists and scored a total of 17 points last season. He was also named to the College Cup all-tournament team.

He played all 25 games for the Hoosiers last season and started 16 of them. He totaled four goals and four assists in 2017, which gives him eight goals and five assists in his IU career heading into his last year. His four assists last season compared to just one in his first two years shows how much Panchot has grown in distributing the ball and making the right pass. It won’t matter if he starts or comes off the bench, Panchot will be a reliable midfielder for the Hoosiers.</p>
