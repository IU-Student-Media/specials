        <p>Former Indiana basketball coach Archie Miller’s time at the university was, overall, nothing special —
          finishing his career at IU with a 33-44 record in Big Ten play.</p>
        <p>What was most memorable about Miller’s IU career, it turns out, was how much it cost to fire him.</p>
        <p>The university spent $10.35 million, paid for completely by anonymous donors, to buy out and replace Miller,
          accounting for the largest buyout in Big Ten basketball since at least 2004. Miller’s buyout figure, along
          with other coaches’ individual payments, reflects the amount to be paid out to a coach by the university at
          the time of termination.</p>
        <p>It turns out underperforming coaches are big business in the Big Ten, as its 14 member schools have spent at
          least $148.7 million in severance payments on football and men’s basketball coaches and staff since fall 2004,
          according to an analysis of NCAA financial reports by the <a href="https://arnoltcenter.org/"

        <p>What the Big Ten has spent to fire coaches pales in comparison to the $1.1 billion Division I Football
          Subdivision Schools spent on coaches’ severance for all sports at the school. Of that amount, $624 million
          bought out football and men’s basketball coaches, according to InvestigateTV’s analysis of the <a

            College Athletics</a> database at Syracuse University.</p>
        <p>“It’s obvious that institutions are throwing money away that could be used to enhance the education, health,
          safety and well-being of student-athletes on mistakes that have been made on hiring,” said Len Elmore, a
          member of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, during an interview with InvestigateTV. “At
          least from the standpoint that absolute winning has to be paramount.”</p>

        <h3>Big Ten Spending</h3>
        <p>Big Ten men’s basketball and football programs spend millions to bolster their programs and become as
          competitive as possible.</p>
        <p>“University administrations love having sports,” said Rodney Fort, professor emeritus of sport management at
          the University of Michigan. “People love college sports and are willing to shell out a bunch of money to watch
          it.”</p>
        <iframe title="Big 10 universities have spent millions buying out football and basketball coaches since 2004"
          aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-O33Z9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O33Z9/1/"

        </script>

        <p>Big spending, however, doesn’t always equal better performance.</p>
        <p>The University of Nebraska has spent $31.2 million in coaching severance payments, the most in the Big Ten
          since 2004, including the years before the Huskers joined the conference in 2011. They have never been a Big
          Ten champion in either football or men’s basketball and have hired five football coaches since 2004, according
          to InvestigateTV.</p>
        <p>Rutgers University, sitting at second most for severance spending, has not seen a Big Ten title in either
          men’s sport since joining the Big Ten in 2014. The university also has the lowest win-loss percentage in
          conference play going 12-58 historically for college football.</p>

        <p>These figures do not reflect any donations given to universities to offset the costs of buyouts.
          Additionally, this data does not include spending for Northwestern, as InvestigateTV and the Arnolt Center
          were unable to access the university’s NCAA financial reports going back to 2004.</p>
        <p>Well-known coaches have come and go, with millions changing hands.</p>
        <p>Football head coach Bo Pelini led the University of Nebraska to at least nine wins a season but never a Big
          Ten title, over the course of seven years, according to ESPN. In 2014, Athletic Director Shawn Eichorst fired
          Pelini after having renewed his contract for another five years when the previous season ended, a decision
          which cost the Huskers $7.65 million.</p>
        <p>Rutgers University fired its head football coach, Chris Ash, in 2019. He held the position for two years,
          finishing with an 8-32 record overall and a <a

            target="_blank">3-26 record</a> in the Big Ten. Originally contracted for five years,
          Ash’s contract was extended for another two years only months before he was bought out of his contract — for
          $8.47 million, according to <a

        <p>A winning record at one university might be a good enough reason for a school to continue paying that coach,
          Fort said, but at another university, that record may mean nothing if the school doesn’t make the playoffs or
          win a championship.</p>
        <p>“Some programs, even performing well isn’t good enough,” Fort said. “If revenues are failing, relative to
          what the AD (athletic director) considers to be the best the program can do, that’s when coaches come under
          scrutiny.”</p>

        <p>In other cases where, even though both the coach and university agree to end a contract mutually, the school
          still pays out. <a

        <h3>Archie Miller falls out of favor at IU</h3>
        <p>Miller was a big recruit for the Hoosiers, coming off a successful run with the Dayton Flyers that netted
          NCAA tournament seeds during four of his six years there, according to IU’s athletics page. However, after
          four seasons as the head coach and a 12-15 losing record at the end of the 2021-22 season, students and fans
          were ready for a fresh start.</p>
        <p>Unlike other financial investments and decisions, sports performance can be extremely difficult to predict,
          Fort said. It’s never certain how coaches will perform each season, let alone what external circumstances
          might present themselves.</p>
        <p>The Arnolt Center sent a public records request to IU for all emails sent to and or from IU Athletic Director
          Scott Dolson and former IU President Michael McRobbie concerning Miller’s buyout between Feb. 1, 2021, and
          April 30, 2021. The request turned up four emails.</p>
        <p>Emails obtained showed discontent among alumni and donors with the dismal record after the end of the
          2020-2021 season.</p>
        <p>Multiple people threatened to pull donations from the university, including IU alumnus Mark Dempsey.</p>
        <p>“Don’t you care that Indiana University is now a laughing stock when it comes to men’s basketball? Do the
          right thing. Fire Miller today,” Dempsey wrote in an email to the university sent in early March 2021. “I
          use(d) to assistant coach Bloomington HS North, hire me, I sure couldn’t do any worse then Miller and I won’t
          cost as much.”</p>

        <p>University administrations use sports to advertise to potential university donors, Fort said, so it’s
          important for teams to perform well. Schools want donors to become nostalgic for their time spent at the
          university on campus, he said, which usually involves going to sports games.</p>
        <p>“You want to walk them through campus on the way during a crisp, wonderful fall day to the football stadium,”
          Fort said. "Because everybody remembers that part of their university experience and cherishes it."</p>
        <p>Of course, a poor record can also affect athletic revenues and how much money the program brings in, Fort
          said. So, both pieces of the buyout puzzle are essential to understanding that process, he said.</p>
        <p>Nick Autry, another alumnus, also expressed frustration about Miller’s IU career in an email to Dolson on
          February 14, 2021. </p>

        <p>Responding to Autry mid-February, Dolson highlighted the high standards he and the program both hold
          regarding IU basketball, the level of success the IU program expected and his commitment to making sure these
          standards and expectations were met.</p>
        <p>Weeks later, on March 15, Miller was fired.</p>
        <p>“Indiana Basketball has a long, rich history of success that dates back generations,” Dolson said in a
          <a href="https://iuhoosiers.com/news/2021/3/15/mens-basketball-statement-from-indiana-university-vice-president-and-director-of-intercollegiate-athletics-scott-dolson.aspx"
            target="_blank">release</a> after the announcement. “I have high expectations for our program, and we have
          not competed at a level
          within the conference or nationally that I believe we should."
        </p>
        <p>Dolson declined an interview for this story.</p>


        <h3>Miller’s big buyout draws criticism</h3>
        <p>The size of Miller’s buyout raised complaints from some donors, and the anonymity factor only added fuel to
          the fire.</p>
        <p>In an email to McRobbie, alumnus and donor Jim Caughlin called Archie Miller’s buyout “disgusting” and
          announced plans to partially pull his donations to the university.</p>
        <p>“Just the fact that somebody can afford this, to buy him out like that — and, a step or two prior to that— is
          why these guys get paid so damn much money in the first place,” Caughlin said during a phone interview with
          the Arnolt Center. “It’s kind of obscene.”</p>

        <p>Elmore said one reason for high buyout prices is that schools choose big-name coaches. They believe a
          high-profile coach will turn the program around, he said.</p>
        <p>“It’s almost like a revolving door,” Elmore said. “You have some coaches who are collecting checks from two
          or three schools simply because they believe that these coaches were the Messiah with regard to football, not
          recognizing there’s a deeper pool of talent that may not have the notoriety of others but certainly may have
          the skill.”</p>

      <div class="story">
        <p>Beyond that reason is the simple fact that fans and athletic directors have high, even unreal, expectations
          of coaches. People want more, Elmore said, and a decent performance may be overshadowed by a lack of
          championship titles or loss to an in-state rival.</p>

        <p>Miller, who <a

            target="_blank">went 0-7</a> against in-state rival Purdue University, isn’t the first coach at IU who’s
          been bought
          out of his contract by anonymous donors. In 2008, head basketball coach Kelvin Sampson left with a $750,000
          buyout, $550,000 of which was paid by anonymous donors, according to the <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/sports/ncaabasketball/23indiana.html#:~:text=BLOOMINGTON%2C%20Ind.,of%20committing%20recruiting%20violations.&text=He%20had%20five%20years%20left,a%20base%20salary%20of%20%24500%2C000."
            target="_blank">New York Times.</a></p>
        <p>Sampson was succeeded by interim coach <a href="https://indianahq.com/dan-dakich/" target="_blank">Dan
            Dakich</a>, who held the role for one season, and Tom Crean, who
          coached for nine seasons before being <a

            target="_blank">bought out of his contract</a> for $4 million in March 2017, leaving the
          role open for Miller.</p>

              his contract in 2017 for $4 million and was replaced by Archie Miller. Following in the footsteps of his
              predecessor, Miller was bought out in 2021 for $10.35 million.

        <p>Caughlin, the IU donor, said he understands academics and athletics are funded differently but doesn’t
          understand the disparity in pay between the two.</p>
        <p>“I would rather hear them say, ‘Well, IU had this many (more) Nobel laureates than winning football teams,’”
          Caughlin said. “But that’s just me.”</p>
        <p>To Caughlin, academics are the school’s purpose, and when the highest-paid employees work for athletics, it
          means IU’s priorities need to change.</p>
        <p>Other alumni and students questioned the anonymity factor behind the buyout. The Arnolt Center sent a public
          records request for the donor agreement between IU Athletics and the IU Foundation. The university denied that
          request citing Indiana code regarding nondisclosure of a donor’s identity.</p>
        <p>Fort said often what happens behind the scenes with coaching decisions is not made public knowledge.</p>
        <p>“A lot of times, we don’t actually know why coaches are fired,” Fort said. “We don’t always get to see that
          answer.”</p>


        <h3>Buyouts propel ‘coaching carousels’ at Big Ten universities</h3>

        <p>In March, the University of Rhode Island hired Miller as its head basketball coach. That made Miller the
          highest-paid state employee in Rhode Island, according to <a
            href="https://turnto10.com/i-team/university-of-rhode-island-rams-basketball-coach-archie-miller-contract-david-cox-thorr-bjorn-dan-mckee-ticket-revenue-bonuses-championships"
            target="_blank">NBC</a> and <a
            href="https://www.si.com/college/indiana/basketball/former-indiana-coach-archie-miller-gets-hired-at-rhode-island-saves-buyout-money"
            target="_blank">Sports Illustrated</a>.</p>
        <p>Miller will make $1.4 million his first two years, and $1.9 million his next three, plus incentives. Because
          of the terms of the buyout, Indiana will save what Miller earns these next two seasons — $2.8 million.</p>
        <p>Second-year head coach Mike Woodson, Miller’s replacement at IU, will make around $3 million annually —
          $550,000 in base salary and $2.45 million in outside marketing and promotion, plus benefits and supplemental
          compensation, according to his contract.</p>
        <p>If IU fires Woodson before April 1, 2025, it will owe him 100% of the base salary and external payment — $3
          million per year — which he would have earned through March 2027, the final year of his contract. If he’s let
          go after that date, this goes down to 50%.</p>
        <p>If a coach is hurting the program, the university will buy them out, and if they’re helping it, another
          school is likely to buy out the coach to give them a better opportunity — and even more money, Fort said.</p>
        <p>That “coaching carousel” will continue unless the programs themselves become inherently more competitive, he
          said.</p>
        <p>“Why it will always be there is the underlying reason that it’s there,” Fort said. “To promote coaches, or at
          that important point, to weed them out.”</p>
