          <p>“The World's Greatest College Weekend” is back.</p>


          <p>In 2020, the race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the race was held without fans in May instead of its usual April race date. This year, the race is back — and so are all the festivities that go along with it.</p>

          <p>For the seniors who haven’t experienced a Little 500 weekend in three years, and for all the other students who have never experienced one, here’s a history of the race and everything else you need to know.</p>

          <p>IU Foundation Executive Director Howdy Wilcox, Jr started the Little 500 in 1951. Wilcox saw students holding informal bike races around dorms and decided to model a bike race after the Indianapolis 500, a race his father won in 1919.</p>

          <p>In 1987, four Kappa Alpha Theta sorority members tried to qualify for the Little 500. On their third qualifying attempt, they finished the run and qualified 34th — one position short of making the field. In response, the inaugural women’s race ran in 1988.  
          </p>

          <p>
          Both races feature up to 33 teams — there are 22 in the women’s race this year — and teams are made up of up to four undergraduate amateur riders, who complete up to 10 exchanges for the men and five for the women throughout the race.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

          <p>
          The races have been held at Bill Armstrong Stadium’s cinder track every year since 1981 and are put on by the IU Student Foundation. Money raised from the Little 500 goes into an IU Student Foundation scholarship fund that has handed out more than $2 million to undergrads, according to the Little 500 website.
          </p>

          <p>
          Kappa Alpha Theta will start in first for the 34th women’s race, which lasts 100 laps. The race takes place at 4 p.m. Friday, April 22.
          </p>

          <p>
          Phi Kappa Psi will sit on the pole for the 71st running of the 200-lap men’s race, which begins at 2 p.m. Saturday, April 23.</p>
