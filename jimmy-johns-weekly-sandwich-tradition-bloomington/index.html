                        John holds a sandwich in front of Jimmy John&rsquo;s. He did not intend to start a tradition
                        when he posted a selfie Aug. 11, 2023. &ldquo;I think I said it almost ironically,&rdquo; he
                        said.

                <p>It&rsquo;s Friday and for IU sophomore John Broadwell, that can only mean one thing: Jimmy
                    John&rsquo;s.</p>
                <p>Jan. 17 marked week 77 in John&rsquo;s quest to have a weekly Jimmy John&rsquo;s sandwich. He gets
                    the same thing every time.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;A No. 5, no onions.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>John&rsquo;s love for Jimmy John&rsquo;s is so deep-rooted it has become part of his weekly routine,
                    a natural commitment he documents with a weekly selfie on his Instagram story. Not only does he make
                    weekly trips to the store for his go-to order, he often arrives dressed in Jimmy
                    John&rsquo;s-branded clothing. And in a digital art class freshman year, he made every one of his
                    projects themed to his favorite sandwich shop.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I always encourage them to consider having a consistent theme to work with; a lot of people
                    might explore grief or something of that nature, or sustainability,&rdquo; professor Dominick
                    Rivers, who taught the course, said. &ldquo;And he came in and was like, &lsquo;Jimmy John&rsquo;s
                    it is.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

                <p>John&rsquo;s first project was a Photoshop piece of the discovery of the No. 5 sandwich &mdash; with
                    no onions, of course.</p>
                <p>After it was finished, his professor encouraged him to print it out and give it to the employees of
                    his go-to Jimmy John&rsquo;s.</p>

                        tintype, like antiquated photography,&rdquo; Dominick Rivers, his professor for the course,
                        said.

                <p>&ldquo;We got it framed, it was in the store right above their ice cube machine for a few
                    months,&rdquo; John said.</p>
                <p>Next was a 3D virtual reality world with a Jimmy John&rsquo;s temple and a website that laid out a
                    conspiracy theory surrounding the creation of Jimmy John&rsquo;s.</p>

                <p>John printed out all the projects he created that semester and compiled them on a bulletin board that
                    hangs directly across from the front door of his apartment.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;My conspiracy board, yeah,&rdquo; he said, explaining his fictional Jimmy John&rsquo;s lore.
                </p>
                <p>John&rsquo;s fictionalized version of history begins in 1450 with the discovery of the No. 5 by
                    Spanish conquistadors, who then disappeared.</p>
                <p>In the 1960s, John imagined, the CIA began to work with a Jimmy John&rsquo;s competitor, Anthony
                    Bolognavich, to replicate the magical life-giving properties of the sandwiches.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;And they don&rsquo;t want you to know this,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;But Jimmy John is that
                    original conquistador. He&rsquo;s lived for hundreds of years, sustaining himself on the power of
                    his magical sandwich.&rdquo;</p>

                        shirts to support
                        John for the state wrestling finals during his senior year. Each shirt had the quote &ldquo;#5
                        No
                        Onions,&rdquo; in reference to John&rsquo;s regular Jimmy John&rsquo;s order.

                <p>John&rsquo;s own Jimmy John&rsquo;s story began during his senior year of high school. He was a
                    wrestler and with every win, he would head to his favorite sandwich shop with his friends to
                    celebrate. When he made it to Indiana state wrestling finals in the spring, his family made custom
                    shirts with his name, school mascot and &mdash; of course &mdash; a Jimmy John&rsquo;s sandwich. So,
                    it was only natural for him to turn to a familiar favorite once he came to IU.</p>
                <p>Each Friday, John crossed the street from his Eigenmann dorm to the tiny 10th Street Jimmy
                    John&rsquo;s for a sandwich to celebrate the end of the week. On Aug. 11, 2023, he posted a selfie
                    of himself at the black plastic table outside the store, holding a wrapped sandwich with the caption
                    &ldquo;first official Jimmy John&rsquo;s Friday went swimmingly.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I think I said it almost ironically,&rdquo; John said.</p>
                <p>He certainly didn&rsquo;t think it would become a weekly tradition. But for 77 weeks, he has kept up
                    the gig. He almost always goes on a Friday and always gets that famous No. 5 sandwich, the Vito.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always gotten. When I was a lad, when I was like eight, my mom
                    picked it out for me, and I like it,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve just been
                    doing ever since.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>He often invites friends to eat with him, but none have remained as devoted as he has. He admits his
                    girlfriend, while &ldquo;supportive,&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t particularly like Jimmy John&rsquo;s.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Personally, I like Subway,&rdquo; Brooke Roessler, his girlfriend of a year and a half, said.

                <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t lie, sometimes it&rsquo;s tough,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But for the most

            <div class="story">

                <p>On one sunny Friday in December, John arrives at Jimmy John&rsquo;s around 1:05 p.m. He&rsquo;s not
                    wearing his signature red Jimmy John&rsquo;s shirt or even his branded Christmas sweater, but he is
                    still dressed for the occasion in a red zip-up and black shorts.</p>
                <p>He orders his regular, paying $6.47 before sitting down at the high top with his sandwich. He unwraps
                    the paper to reveal salami, capocollo and provolone, topped with lettuce, tomato, oil, vinegar and
                    oregano-basil, on freshly baked French bread.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the biggest thing that separates them from other competitors,&rdquo; John
                    says. &ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful bread.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>He speaks with wisdom, nodding as he expounds on topics from the Jimmy John&rsquo;s rewards program
                    to the controversial Picklewich. Soon enough, he finishes his sandwich and heads back out to his
                    car.</p>
                <p>But he&rsquo;ll be back; John doesn&rsquo;t plan to stop his weekly Jimmy John&rsquo;s trips anytime
                    soon. After all, he even shares a name with the store. His take on the matching names?</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I think it was destiny.&rdquo;</p>
