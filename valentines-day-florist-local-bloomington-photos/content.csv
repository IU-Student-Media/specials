Judy Phegley, Lisa&rsquo;s mother, opened Judy&rsquo;s Flowers and Gifts 43 years ago. Lisa took over the shop for her mother who now works part-time, except around Valentine&rsquo;s Day. The two said Valentine&rsquo;s Day is the shop&rsquo;s busiest day of the year partly because everyone wants the flowers on that day. They said on other holidays, like Mother&rsquo;s Day, people don&rsquo;t care as much if their special someone gets flowers on that day; they&rsquo;re OK with them receiving flowers on any day around the holiday."
