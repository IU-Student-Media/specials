                <p>Curt Cignetti arrived in Bloomington on Dec. 1, 2023. He immediately noticed many people didn&rsquo;t
                    think Indiana football could win.</p>
                <p>Historically, it&rsquo;s a program that has always found a way to lose. Any glimmer of hope was
                    typically shot down by a heartbreaking loss. But athletic director Scott Dolson thought it was a
                    &ldquo;sleeping giant.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Cignetti awoke it.</p>
                <p>The first-year Hoosiers head coach proved that Indiana football winning &mdash; and winning big &mdash; is possible. He led his squad
                    to an 11-2 overall record, including their first-ever College Football Playoff appearance.</p>
                <p>On Tuesday, Cignetti became the first Indiana Athletics head coach since former men&rsquo;s
                    basketball coach Bob Knight to speak at a student-only lecture as the Union Board hosted &ldquo;A
                    Conversation with Coach Cignetti&rdquo; at the IU Auditorium in Bloomington. IU junior Joe Cronin
                    and IU sophomore Reid Sprenkle moderated the event.</p>

                        dominant victory</a>; however, two things stood out to Cignetti when recalling the win.
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;What I remember about the first game was number one, it was really hot,&rdquo; Cignetti said.
                    &ldquo;But number two, when we came out for the second half, like half the people had already left.
                    And I couldn&rsquo;t just quit dwelling on how many people had left in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Cignetti

                        addressed the fans&rsquo; exodus
                    </a> in his post-game press conference. He said he knew about
                    the tradition of fans leaving early.
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;I knew that was something that had to change, but it was only going to change if we
                    won,&rdquo; Cignetti said. &ldquo;You build it, and they will come.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>The Hoosiers made their first appearance inside the historic Rose Bowl Stadium since 1968 when they
                    faced off against UCLA on Sept. 14. There was sentimental fanfare heading into the matchup. Not for
                    Cignetti.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going out there, this is a business trip. We&rsquo;re going
                    out there to kick some ass,&rsquo;&rdquo; Cignetti said. &ldquo;You know what I mean? And
                    that&rsquo;s what we did. I mean, we dominated their ass.&rdquo;</p>

                    instilled and increased the level of belief and confidence in the Hoosiers,
                    Cignetti said.

                <p>&ldquo;Surprisingly, we had not beaten Northwestern at Northwestern in 32 years,&rdquo; Cignetti
                    said. &ldquo;Can you believe that? 32 years since we beat Northwestern at Northwestern.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>As Cignetti walked off the field toward the Hoosiers&rsquo; locker room, he noticed the sea of
                    Hoosier fans in the north endzone bleachers. Their excitement, he said, was way over the top, and he
                    felt it.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;So I felt like I&rsquo;d join them and show the appreciation and make them part of the team
                    even more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we did our little &lsquo;Go IU&rsquo; chant, which I guess is
                    new around here. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean we got IU on our helmets so &lsquo;Go IU&rsquo; kind of
                    makes sense. I like to keep it simple you know.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s such a winning edge,&rdquo; Cignetti said about the sold-out crowd. &ldquo;I

                <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at least 10, 14, 17 points,&rdquo; Cignetti said about the home-field advantage.
                    &ldquo;When we play at home and that place is packed and people are going crazy, it's two scores or
                    more difference.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>It very well may have been the difference against the Huskies as the Hoosiers trotted backup

                <p>The first-year Hoosiers head coach was confused that Purdue was the standard for some of his players,
                    so he delivered a message at halftime of the Indiana men&rsquo;s basketball game Dec. 1, 2023, just

                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m super fired up about this opportunity,&rdquo; Cignetti yelled. &ldquo;I've never
                    taken a backseat to anybody and don't plan on starting now. Purdue sucks, but so does Michigan and
                    Ohio State.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>But being at the helm of Indiana football is where Cignetti wants to be long-term.</p>
