                <p>When he realized the human remains were in the Student Building a few years later, Wesley said he
                    asked the anthropology department chair to move his office to a different building.</p>
                <p>“I was extremely disturbed by it. Something that people outside of a Native community
                    do not understand is that we're aware of our ancestors and their presence,” Wesley said. “I
                    couldn't concentrate or focus, and I had to move out.”</p>
                <p>Wesley was quickly given a new office, but he said he still didn’t feel comfortable teaching at IU.
                    According to interviews with Wesley and other faculty, the majority of the anthropology department
                    through the early 2000s adhered to “old school” teachings which cast Native American people as
                    objects of scientific study rather than people with human rights.</p>

                <p>In 1990, the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nagpra/index.htm" target="_blank">Native American
                        Graves Protection and Repatriation Act</a> mandated that federally funded
                    institutions, including IU, start working to return collections of Native American human remains and
                    cultural items to Tribes through a process called repatriation. But none of the human remains at IU
                    were repatriated until 24 years after the law passed, eight years after Wesley left the university.
                </p>
                <p>Slow responses to NAGPRA were not unusual, especially right after its passage, when there was little
                    guidance on best practices for both institutions and Tribal nations. Fifteen years after the
                    legislation passed, only 40.5% of institutions subject to NAGPRA had reported completing at least
                    one repatriation, according to <a href="https://grantsdev.cr.nps.gov/NagpraPublic/Home/Inventory"

                <p>But in interviews with the Indiana Daily Student, current and former faculty alleged that IU avoided
                    good-faith compliance with NAGPRA for years. Administrators pushed the sensitive, difficult and
                    extensive repatriation process onto anthropology faculty who had full-time research and teaching
                    responsibilities and were not prepared to complete NAGPRA work.</p>
                <p>In inventories of human remains and cultural items that IU was legally required to report by 1995,
                    nearly all were classified as “culturally unidentifiable,” taking advantage of a <a

                        target="_blank">loophole</a> that
                    allowed institutions to avoid repatriation and continue research. Despite faculty advocacy for
                    repatriation as early as the late ‘90s, IU didn’t fund NAGPRA compliance until 2013 — three years
                    after the law was updated to close the loophole.</p>

                        target="_blank">January ProPublica investigation</a> of
                    repatriation efforts across the country, which found that IU reported the fifth-largest collection
                    of Indigenous human remains in the country. On April 21, a <a

                        target="_blank">Senate probe</a> scrutinized compliance
                    processes at the five institutions with the largest collections, including IU, after “troubling
                    testimony detailing ongoing issues related to the timely completion of NAGPRA repatriations.”</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh, IU faculty and a Tribal representative have expressed concerns about this scrutiny into
                    NAGPRA work, fearful that adding pressure on institutions and Tribes without providing them with
                    more resources would rush repatriation and make it harder to do it properly.</p>
                <p>“Trying to expedite this process could turn very easily into kind of a garage sale mentality, of
                    saying, ‘Well, we just have to get them out of our museum, we'll just give them to the first Tribe
                    that shows interest,’ and that's not good,” said Carrie V. Wilson, NAGPRA coordinator at the Quapaw
                    Nation. “That's not going to help anybody. I don't think that was the intent of NAGPRA.”</p>
                <p>The story of NAGPRA at IU is one of great complexity. Faced with the problematic legacy of how IU
                    acquired its vast collection of human remains to begin with, IU employees and Tribal members agree
                    the process of NAGPRA today can never fully right the wrongs of the past. But if done right, it can
                    help everyone involved move forward.</p>

                <h3>Decades of avoiding repatriation</h3>

                <p>Wesley Thomas said when he was an assistant professor at IU from 2001 to 2006, NAGPRA was already a
                    core concept taught in anthropology classes. But he described it as a “hush” topic among faculty,
                    along with other Indigenous issues.</p>
                <p>Wesley is a member of the Navajo Nation, and he was the first full-time Native American professor in
                    the Department of Anthropology and the only one during his time at IU, when he also founded the <a
                        href="https://firstnations.indiana.edu/" target="_blank">IU
                        First Nations Educational & Cultural Center</a>. During those years, he recalled other faculty
                    members
                    often changing the subject away from Indigenous topics as soon as he walked in the room.</p>
                <p>“If I start(ed) asking questions, that would upset the whole department and the university,” Wesley
                    said.</p>

                <p>He said the unwelcoming culture of the department contributed to his decision to leave IU and return
                    to the Navajo Nation in 2006, where he taught for years at Navajo Technical University and is now a
                    professor emeritus.</p>

                <p>“I felt extremely awkward, uncomfortable, unpleasant — that I shouldn't be there,” Wesley said.</p>
                <p>Since Wesley left, the department has hired at least three more Native American faculty members,
                    including two who still work at IU, according to professor emeritus April Sievert. </p>
                <p>Current anthropology chair Andrea Wiley said the department has improved its inclusion of Indigenous
                    perspectives in the years since Wesley worked there.</p>
                <p>“Over the course of my chairship we have undertaken a hard honest assessment of our troubled legacy
                    as a department particularly with regard to the collection of ancestral human remains,” Wiley said.
                    “We have held listening sessions and educational sessions to inform us all (students, faculty,
                    staff) about our department’s history in this regard. We have worked very closely with the NAGPRA
                    office to ensure that all ancestral Native American human remains are repatriated and we continue to
                    hold educational sessions so that departmental members are aware of this process and what it
                    entails.”</p>

                <p>While most anthropology professors in the early 2000s were unaware of or uninterested in NAGPRA,
                    according
                    to multiple faculty interviews, a small group pushed for better compliance efforts starting in the
                    late ‘90s.</p>
                <p class="show-mobile">In 2000, Richard Wilk became the department chair of the anthropology department.
                    Wilk said he was

                <p>NAGPRA established a 1995 deadline for institutions to compile an <a

                        and cultural items in their possession</a>. The goal was to determine how many each institution
                    had

                    of Archaeology, nearly all of the combined 5,800 reported human remains were marked culturally
                    unidentifiable. Students and faculty, including Cook, continued to research the ancestral remains
                    for decades after the inventory was submitted, according to faculty interviews. Research only fully
                    stopped within the last few years, said Director Jayne-Leigh Thomas. She said IU established a

                <p>“You could basically get away with saying that everything's unaffiliated and we don't have to do
                    anything about it, especially when you think about how much it would cost and the time and the
                    effort required,” Wilk said.</p>
                <p>Wilk, who is now a professor emeritus, said he raised concerns about IU’s potential noncompliance
                    within IU and with the National NAGPRA office, but he was dismissed at every turn.</p>
                <p>He asked his former boss, Kumble Subbaswamy, then-dean of the College of Arts & Sciences, to provide
                    resources for NAGPRA compliance work, but Subbaswamy declined, citing financial constraints.
                    Subbaswamy, now the chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, did not respond to emails
                    from the IDS asking about this exchange.</p>
                <p>Wilk wrote letters to and called the National NAGPRA office, hoping an official notice of
                    noncompliance would push IU administrators to act, but he said the office was too busy to
                    investigate IU’s inventories.</p>
                <p>“I think rather than active opposition, what we got was lack of movement,” Wilk said. “There's a
                    difference between actively opposing something and just not dealing with it. And I think that's what
                    we were doing for a long time, was just not dealing with it.”</p>
                <p>This avoidance wasn’t surprising to Wilk, he said. Most of the faculty in the early 2000s had been
                    educated during a time when most anthropologists considered Native American remains valuable objects
                    of scientific study, not a human rights issue, Wilk said.</p>

                <p>Pyburn said another reason anthropologists across the country didn’t respond well to NAGPRA was
                    because they defined respect differently than the Native Americans whose ancestral remains they
                    studied.</p>
                <p>She said many anthropologists were surprised by NAGPRA, because they thought they were being
                    respectful by devoting their lives to understanding Native American history, but didn’t take into
                    account how what they deemed to be respectful was extremely harmful in the eyes of the people they
                    studied. </p>
                <p>Pyburn said the field has begun to shift only recently to be more inclusive of Indigenous
                    perspectives.</p>
                <p>“I've spent my entire career trying to make this happen and trying to change the discipline so that
                    it becomes a different kind of endeavor,” Pyburn said. “The point of what I do and the point of what
                    I encourage my students to do is to address the injustices that are significantly a result of
                    colonialism.”</p>

                <h3>Why does IU have so many human remains?</h3>

                <p>IU originally reported more than 5,800 Native American human remains held by both the Department of

                <p>Over decades, philanthropist Eli Lilly, grandson of the founder of Eli Lilly and Company, coordinated
                    and funded most of the projects that ultimately brought thousands of Native American human remains
                    and cultural items to IU.</p>
                <p>Starting in the 1930s, Lilly became fascinated with archaeology, and made use of his extensive

                <p>In the mid-1930s, Lilly provided fellowships to linguistic anthropologist Charles F. Voegelin,
                    archaeologist James B. Griffin and physical anthropologist Georg K. Neumann, who specialized in the
                    study of skeletal remains.</p>

                <p>After it first surfaced in 1833, the Walam Olum was repeatedly used by researchers to try to justify
                    personal beliefs or political agendas with Native history.</p>
                <p>Constantine Rafinesque, the scientist who claimed to have found the original copy of the Walam Olum

                        Nations in Indiana.</a> Given this historical context, Rafinesque likely had a political
                    motivation to
                    publish the Walam Olum because it claimed the Lenape people migrated from the Old World, and he
                    hoped to generate sympathy for Native American people by linking their genetic and cultural heritage
                    to Europeans.

                <p>Regardless of Rafinesque’s motivations, his approach delegitimized Indigenous perspectives,

                    perceptions of advanced civilizations to deserve respect and dignity, according to Grimm and

                <p>Partnering with Indiana University was a logical next step for Lilly, who needed an institution to
                    house artifacts and continue to produce research as part of his long-term goal of ensuring a future
                    for anthropology in Indiana. By mid-1947, Lilly had worked with then-Chancellor Herman B Wells to
                    establish the IU Department of Archaeology, instating Black, Voegelin and Neumann as core faculty.
                </p>
                <p>A few years later, Lilly finally achieved his goal of publishing a manuscript on the Walam Olum,
                    titled “Walam Olum or Red Score: The Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians.” The
                    book received mixed reviews, as anthropologists recognized the impressive scope of the project but
                    remained skeptical of the Walam Olum as a primary document.</p>

                <p>“As far as trying to understand the logic behind it and all that kind of stuff, I can't even begin to
                    go there,” she said. “There's lots of human remains out there, and they still have to be reburied.”

                <h3>Starting the NAGPRA office</h3>

                <p>In the early 1990s, Wilson received a letter from the Glenn Black Lab notifying her that IU had human
                    remains and cultural items likely affiliated with the Quapaw. Those remains wouldn’t be repatriated
                    until decades later.</p>
                <p>Wilson was and still is the only dedicated NAGPRA worker at the Quapaw Nation. She said she tried to
                    get in touch with the Glenn Black Lab a couple times over the years but personnel kept changing.</p>
                <p class="show-mobile">Then in 2013, IU began a series of changes that would finally enable good-faith
                    repatriation work to
                    begin. April Sievert became the director of the Glenn Black Lab, and began to address NAGPRA
                    compliance. A few months later, IU hired Jayne-Leigh Thomas as the first director of its new NAGPRA
                    Office.</p>

                    communication from many institutions. So in 2014, she and Sievert flew to Oklahoma and drove to
                    multiple states to visit representatives from at least 13 other Tribal nations, including Wilson, in

                    more difficult, as consultations typically require flights and it’s harder to find reburial land.

                <p>Soon after their first meeting, Wilson worked with Jayne-Leigh and Sievert to repatriate materials to
                    the Quapaw Nation. As they continued working together, Wilson said she realized the Quapaw Nation
                    was linked to the Angel Mounds burial site.</p>
                <p>“I was convinced we were affiliated, and I worked with Dr. Jayne-Leigh and April Sievert on
                    establishing cultural affiliation to Angel Mounds,” Wilson said. “So, it eventually went forward.”

                    700
                    individuals were reburied.</p>
                <p>“Each one is different, and the reburial in that one was very spiritual and it was very emotional,”
                    Wilson said. “It really turned out very, very nice, and it was very appropriate for spring and new
                    birth, and new ideas and new friends, and actually just a new viewpoint to start all over again.”
                </p>
                <p>Since IU founded its NAGPRA office, its staff have completed about a dozen separate repatriation
                    projects, reburying more than 1,000 of more than 5,800 reported human remains, <a

                        target="_blank">based on public data</a>. The NAGPRA office also worked with administrators to
                    move as much of the collection as possible out of the Glenn Black Lab and the Student Building into
                    a new secure, climate-controlled facility that was built in 2018, according to Sievert.</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh said while NAGPRA work takes time to do properly, she hopes IU’s entire collection will
                    be repatriated well before she retires.</p>
                <p>Richard Wilk, the former department chair who raised concerns about IU’s potential non-compliance
                    with NAGPRA, said he was very happy when IU established a NAGPRA Office in 2013, and has been
                    impressed with the progress in the decade since.</p>
                <p>“It was much delayed. But when the university finally woke up, they really woke up,” Wilk said.</p>

                <p>The probe followed a ProPublica investigation into public repatriation data <a
                        href="https://projects.propublica.org/repatriation-nagpra-database/institution/indiana-university/"
                        target="_blank">calling out IU</a> as one of
                    the institutions with the largest reported number of Indigenous human remains that haven’t yet been
                    repatriated.</p>
                <p>The National NAGPRA Office also recently proposed <a
                        href="https://culturalpropertynews.org/nagpra-major-changes-proposed-for-2023-to-native-american-repatriation-law/"
                        target="_blank">new regulations</a> that aim to speed up the
                    repatriation process, which have been criticized by some Tribal members.</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh, Pyburn and Wilson all expressed concerns about the recent scrutiny of NAGPRA work, which
                    they said could put unhelpful pressure on both Tribes and institutions to rush the repatriation
                    process.</p>
                <p>Wilson said she fears the <a
                        href="https://culturalpropertynews.org/nagpra-major-changes-proposed-for-2023-to-native-american-repatriation-law/"
                        target="_blank">proposed NAGPRA regulations</a> might add deadlines that could further strain
                    Tribes and museums that already lack proper funding for NAGPRA work.</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh Thomas expressed frustration about recent scrutiny, and said it perpetuates common
                    misconceptions about NAGPRA, like the idea that today’s collection sizes reflect on the quality of
                    NAGPRA work today.</p>
                <p>“Having large numbers in your dataset doesn't mean you're out of compliance, and it doesn't mean
                    you're not doing good work,” Jayne-Leigh said. “You can have exceptionally small collections and be
                    anti-NAGPRA and refuse to work with communities.”</p>
                <p>Instead, she said the size of collections reflects on the practices of institutions decades and even
                    centuries ago.</p>

                        largest collections were the subject of an April 21 Senate probe that scrutinized their NAGPRA
                        compliance efforts.</h5>

                </figure>
                <p>In a statement to the IDS, the ProPublica reporting team behind the repatriation investigation wrote,
                    “Before publication, ProPublica sought comment from each of the universities named in our reporting,
                    including Indiana University. Director [Jayne-Leigh] Thomas did not respond to our requests. Our
                    reporting team welcomes feedback on our coverage or corrections, which can be emailed to
                    repatration@propublica.org. We are aware that the self-reported inventory records are incomplete and
                    likely underestimates. We write about this in our stories and methodology section.”</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh also said it would be more helpful if the senators worked with the National NAGPRA Office
                    directly.</p>
                <p>“To some extent, that's the whole point of National NAGPRA is to investigate NAGPRA noncompliance,”
                    Jayne-Leigh said. “It would be great if the senators could work with National NAGPRA to either
                    increase penalties or give more grants.”</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh also echoed Wilson’s concerns about rushing NAGPRA work.</p>
                <p>“If a university hurries up just because of pressure from senators, media outlets and other
                    organizations, collections might be left behind, there could be funerary objects not accounted for,”
                    Jayne-Leigh said. “My work with Tribal nations needs to be dictated by their timelines and concerns,
                    not any pressure from the public or outside parties.”</p>
                <p>April Sievert, the former Glenn Black Lab director, said via email that after reading the Senate
                    probe, she thinks the Senators don’t understand the scope of repatriation.</p>
                <p>“Yes, institutions waited way too long. However, in the real world of NAGPRA, a big repatriation” can
                    take years to do properly, Sievert wrote. “Demanding that all the institutions and the Tribes who’ve
                    been waiting so long scramble to transfer materials in say three years will leave many Tribes
                    bereft, especially if they don’t have the resources or staff to make claims or be considered as part
                    of larger repatriations.”</p>

                <p>Wilson said increased federal funding for the National NAGPRA Office and more flexible grant options
                    would help facilitate efficient, quality NAGPRA work.</p>
                <p>Right now, Wilson cannot request funding for her one-person department — she can only request one-off
                    grants for specific projects. She said money to help Tribes create and maintain NAGPRA departments
                    would go a lot further.</p>
                <p>More sustained funding for national NAGPRA would help expedite often backlogged processes. For
                    example, disputes between institutions and Tribes must be processed by National NAGPRA before any
                    fines or other legal action can proceed, but the office is typically very backed up. The office
                    <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/department-interior-takes-steps-enhance-compliance-native-american-graves-protection"
                        target="_blank">hired its first investigator</a> at the end of January to look into
                    noncompliance at museums and
                    universities, but Wilson said one investigator is far from sufficient to tackle this large
                    undertaking.
                </p>
                <p>National NAGPRA declined to be interviewed for this story, citing time constraints.</p>
                <p>Pyburn said more money to help Tribes fund NAGPRA work is especially important.</p>
                <p>“This is a problem that is squarely on the shoulders of the people who excavated the human remains,”
                    Pyburn said. “We can't expect the people whose ancestors we're talking about to provide hundreds of
                    hours of free labor to negotiate the process, to write the grants that are necessary to cover the
                    costs of the transportation and the rehousing of human remains and the appropriate ceremonial
                    practices, all of those things are time consuming and expensive.”</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh also noted that stories about repatriation work are often kept personal and private,
                    because they involve personal grief, like all funerals. NAGPRA coordinators are also careful to
                    avoid disclosing the location of reburial grounds in most cases to deter looters. For these reasons,
                    she explained that IU’s NAGPRA department often doesn’t publicize its progress, and the public
                    typically does not know about the complexity of ongoing projects within the department.</p>
                <p>Despite her issues with the ProPublica story, Jayne-Leigh acknowledged the reporting has been
                    beneficial in calling out noncompliant institutions.</p>
                <p>“The silver lining is that for institutions that were not doing anything, hopefully it will get their
                    administrators to realize that they need to be doing better, and they will start to fund offices,”
                    she said.</p>
                <p>Wilson said while different Tribes and other groups have their own opinions about the best way to
                    approach NAGPRA work, they have a shared goal: repatriation.</p>
                <p>“We all may do it in different ways, but we all have common goals, and that's to repatriate,” Wilson
                    said. “Especially Tribes who have been removed from their homelands and been decimated by disease,
                    it gives us an opportunity to rediscover our past. It actually can be a spiritual journey and enrich
                    the Tribe in many different ways, if you do it right.”</p>

                    <p>The IDS spent more than three months researching NAGPRA at IU, conducting extensive

                        reading historical documents. Reporting on the history of anthropology at IU referred to
