<p>Sexual violence haunts college campuses across the country. At IU, the damage is inescapable.</p>

<p>In the past couple of weeks, <a href = "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2017/09/sexual-assault-reported-at-briscoe-residence-hall" target = "_blank"> at least three campus rapes </a> have been reported in places where IU students should feel safe. One was reported in Wright Quad, another in Read Center. At Briscoe Quad, a freshman told police she was raped by someone she had met at a party. Another young woman reported <a href = "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2017/09/police-receive-report-of-sexual-assault-sunday" target = "_blank">a fourth incident</a>, this one off campus, saying a stranger had grabbed her from behind and climbed on top of her on North Walnut Street.</p>

<p>IU is fighting back. The flyers, the banners, the attempts to educate students on consent — all of it matters. But a yearlong investigation by the Indiana Daily Student makes it clear that the University’s attempt to investigate sexual assaults is deeply flawed. </p>

<p>The good news is that IU has the power to fix some of the problems right now.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the critiques cited most frequently and some possible solutions, including approaches already adopted at other Big Ten universities. Most of these proposals would cost almost no extra money and would not conflict with federal guidelines.</p>

<p>IU officials say they are constantly seeking to improve the system. They say they are particularly interested in hearing from students on how to do this. </p>

<p>This is a chance to prove it.</p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>Not enough straight talk from the University.</b> When asked about shortcomings in the system, administrators tend to retreat behind bureaucratic explanations of what policy allows. Some at IU argue that the University's system of investigating sexual assault is “educational,” not “punitive,” and that it teaches problem-solving and decision-making. Students who have suffered sexual assault — and students who have been accused of sexual assault — find this a condescending dodge that glosses over the real consequences of these cases.</p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Lead the conversation. </b>Create forums for the campus community to share frustrations and suggestions. Find new ways to gather input from those who may not be comfortable speaking in public. Recognize that this is more than a learning experience for students. It is deeply personal. Stop hiding behind policy, and ask if it is time for those policies to change.</p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>Not enough protection for students who report rape. </b>No-contact and no-trespass orders issued by the University are loosely enforced at best, leaving those who have been assaulted vulnerable to harassment and retaliation. IU does not routinely share these orders with its own police department, leaving officers in the dark when students report that their attackers have shown up at their dorm. When students complain, the Office of Student Conduct often goes no further than issuing another warning that simply repeats what is already in the no-contact order. To make matters worse, these orders are only enforceable on campus and not elsewhere in the city.</p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Share information. </b>When women run into their alleged attackers on campus, it can be hard to prove the contact was intentional. But several women told the IDS they had suffered clear violations, and the University did next to nothing. A few simple changes in the system would help. Create a database that shares all no-contact and no-trespass orders with the IU Police Department. Update the intake protocol at the Office of Student Conduct so that every time a student reports a sexual assault, someone from the Maurer School of Law’s Protective Order Project is on hand to help the student obtain a legal protective order. </p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>IU punishes students who do not cooperate with the system.</b> Investigators in the Office of Student Conduct place holds on the student accounts of potential witnesses and those accused in sexual assault cases. These holds prevent students — even those eager to help in the process — from registering for classes, requesting transcripts and even graduating. The University does not place these holds on the accounts of those who report sexual assault. Even so, the holds are another burden for these women, leaving them feeling guilty for dragging others into such complications. </p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Stop using the holds. </b>Other universities such as Ball State University, do not use this method of compulsion because they worry that holds will alienate students who might otherwise comply with investigators’ requests. IU should drop the practice, too, especially if its officials are sincere when they insist that their system is not intended to be punitive.</p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>The University keeps evidence secret. </b>Students are usually not allowed to review their own case files until shortly before their hearings. Women who have reported sexual assault are left with no idea of what the accused and others are claiming. Men facing expulsion have no idea how to prepare for their hearings. Either side can ask a lawyer to review their cases, but by the time the files are opened, it can be too late for a lawyer to truly help. IU officials insist that the restrictions they impose allow investigators to work more efficiently. </p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Open the files to those with the most at stake.</b> When fairness is so essential to both sides, both the accused and their accusers need to know the facts from day one. These students’ desire to keep up on their cases should not be considered an inconvenience. The credibility of any system — at a university or elsewhere — is built on transparency.</p>

		What are the possible outcomes of the University sexual assault hearing process?

</figure>
</aside>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>The University will not let students copy their own files. </b>IU does not provide copies of investigative files to the involved parties unless compelled by a legal order, and it does not allow students or their lawyers to make copies of their own. They are allowed to take handwritten notes, but that is it — a challenge when some files run nearly 100 pages long.</p>

<p>IU points out that the files often contain information on several students, and that those students’ privacy is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Given that these are sexual assault cases, the officials worry that releasing files could allow medical records and other sensitive information to be posted online or shared among students who are not involved. They note that FERPA only requires universities to allow students to inspect their files, not copy them.</p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Do more than the minimum. </b>The University does a disservice to students by insisting that it only has to meet the law’s minimum requirements. Is that really the position IU wants to take in such important cases? Other schools have no problem going above and beyond the FERPA minimum. The University of Minnesota provides redacted copies of these files. The University of Maryland releases the entire file to either the accused or their accusers, providing they sign a waiver. There is no reason IU cannot adopt a similar approach.</p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>IU routinely destroys potentially crucial evidence. </b>Attorneys who represent students accused of rape complain that the University discards video surveillance from the dorms and other campus buildings. IU only holds onto the videos for a month, but many cases stretch much longer. Until the students and their lawyers are allowed to review the files, they do not necessarily know what evidence will matter. Are the women looking for video that confirms that the man they have named did enter their dorm on the night in question? Are the men seeking video that shows they did not enter that dorm that night? Are lawyers looking for video that proves their client was elsewhere on campus when the assault occurred? By the time the different stakeholders are given access to the files and better understand the case, it can be too late.</p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Establish a protocol for preserving evidence.</b> Emily Springston, IU’s Title IX coordinator, points out that not every video contains valuable evidence. Yet there is no way to know unless both sides have a chance to check. One of the first steps IU takes when opening a sexual assault investigation should be immediately requesting and setting aside any video potentially relevant to the case — including video from another location that might confirm the alibi of the accused. </p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>The University puts students in the uncomfortable position of defending their own cases. </b>These students — many who have never had to represent themselves in a formal hearing of any kind — complain that IU makes them play lawyer. University policy forces the actual lawyers in these situations into silence. </p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Explore other options. </b>Some universities, including the University of Minnesota, the University of Iowa and the University of Wisconsin, allow attorneys to participate in hearings and represent their clients. At Iowa, the university will connect students with resources if they can't afford their own lawyer. Consider speaking with officials at these and other schools to see how different models work. </p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>Those entrusted to decide these cases are underqualified.</b> The three-member panels that hear sexual misconduct cases are made of IU employees. Few have legal experience, but the University believes its annual day-and-a-half-long training is qualification enough to hear evidence and place sanctions. With tricky evidence standards and the complications of defining what it means to give and receive consent, students and attorneys argue this training is not enough.</p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Get someone who is qualified.</b> Consider inviting members of the legal community who are specially trained in the complexities of sexual assault cases to serve on hearing panels. George Mason University has done this using a three-member panel of retired judges. Simpler still: Recruit experienced professors from the Maurer School of Law or from IU’s Department of Criminal Justice to help decide cases.</p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>IU controls every step of the process. </b>The Office of Student Conduct investigates reports of sexual assault. University employees decide the cases and hand out punishments for students they believe have committed rape. And the dean of students reviews appeals. Attorneys argue it is unfair for every stage of these cases to be decided by employees whose paychecks are signed by IU.</p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Allow independent review. </b>If the University’s system is as strong as it claims to be, its investigations and hearings should stand the test of external review. When a student appeals IU’s decision, let someone from outside of the University consider the appeal. The University of Michigan does this, allowing an attorney from outside its system to consider whether cases were heard appropriately.</p>

<figcaption>
A pamphlet about sexual assault and violence lies on the table of the hearing room in the Office of Student Conduct. Pamphlets and flyers explaining sexual misconduct can be found across the IU campus.  
</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>Appeals are rarely granted, even when new evidence surfaces.</b> The University only considers appeals claiming that IU did not follow its own policy — a policy some students and attorneys say is flawed to begin with — or that the University’s punishments are too harsh. Students are only allowed to appeal once within five days of receiving IU’s decision. In a system designed to provide expedient answers, the results of rape kits and DNA testing are rarely completed in time. While University officials say they will consider new evidence after the appeals window closes, one attorney was discouraged from sending forensic results, citing IU's lack of training for those who consider appeals.</p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Consider new evidence. </b>Amend the sexual misconduct policy to accept appeals on a basis that new, factual information has become available after the University hearing. This protects both students who have reported and been accused of sexual assault. What if the DNA does not match a student suspended or expelled for sexual assault? What if such evidence proves a student did commit rape after IU’s system cleared the student and allowed him or her to return to classes? Further train appeals officers on forensic evidence standards.</p>

<h4> PROBLEM</h4>
<p><b>It has seldom discussed the causes of five investigations opened by the federal Office of Civil Rights and the results of internal investigations into former employees</b>, including that of former Office of Student Ethics director Jason Casares. After a ballet student reported being sexually assaulted by an IU Jacobs School of Music lecturer, the University <a href = "http://specials.idsnews.com/titleixinvestigation/" target = "_blank">waited six weeks</a> to involve campus police in its investigation. Like in the case of Casares, the University conducted an internal investigation and refused to share its findings.</p>

<h4> SOLUTION</h4>
<p><b>Light and Truth.</b> Answer tough questions about why these federal investigations have been open for years and explain how IU plans to correct its mistakes. Speak openly about investigations of former employees, and be transparent about why they are no longer here. Invite those who have the most at stake — students, attorneys and other community leaders — to take an active role in fixing the system, and live up to IU’s motto of Lux et Veritas.</p>
