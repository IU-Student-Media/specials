                <h3>History of the IUCSS</h3>
                <p class="dropcap">The work of finding potential aberrations in the established laws of physics began in
                    the late 20th
                    century with the work of Alan Kostelecky, now a distinguished professor of theoretical physics at
                    IU, and one of the world&rsquo;s leading authorities on spacetime symmetries. </p>
                <p>Working within String Theory &mdash; a promising framework developed in the late 20th century that
                    attempted to unify physics under one theory of everything &mdash; Kostelecky said he demonstrated the
                    existence of processes within the theory that could break established rules including Lorentz and
                    CPT symmetry. This spurred him to look into other ways these symmetries could be violated in nature.
                </p>
                <p>He developed the Standard Model Extension, a theory containing all possible violations of these
                    rules. This prompted deluge of scientists to test if these violations exist; in the early 2000s,
                    scientists at IU realized they had a critical mass of people who were interested in studying these
                    potential violations. They founded the IUCSS soon after in 2010.</p>

                <p>The center, composed of a rotating cast of graduate students and around 20 full-time IU scientists
                    and professors, has attracted talent with all sorts of specializations: theorists, experimentalists
                    and everyone in between. Every three years, it brings together scientists from around the world who
                    are interested in their field of research for a conference. Its last <a href="https://indiana-my.sharepoint.com/personal/iucss_iu_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fiucss%5Fiu%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Farchived%2Dmeetings%2F2022%2Dmeeting%2DCPT22%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fiucss%5Fiu%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Farchived%2Dmeetings&ga=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meeting</a> was held virtually in
                    2022 and included participants from 5 continents.</p>
                <p>River Govin, a graduate student at the center studying modified neutrino energies, said bringing
                    together very niche disciplines &mdash; from those studying unimaginably small particles to theorists
                    working on overarching theory &mdash; is one of the main benefits of the center.</p>
                <p>Opposed to having one specialized group searching for violations, he said they have multiple groups
                    using different approaches and background knowledge &mdash; all looking for the same thing.</p>
                <p>There is also the value of having experimentalists and theorists working together, which Snow, an
                    experimentalist, said is the focus of their conferences.</p>
                    <!--We could pull the below quote and add a image of snow here-->
                <p>&ldquo;It's a two-way street, because, if you only do the theoretical work in a vacuum, more often than not
                    it's very unlikely that what you thought up as a possibility is testable,&rdquo; Snow said. &ldquo;The good
                    theorists keep a very sharp eye on what is happening in experiment(s), and what you could do given
                    our level of technology.&rdquo;</p>

                <h3>Lorentz, CPT symmetry drive the center&rsquo;s research</h3>
                <p class="dropcap">The center&rsquo;s research focuses on testing whether two fundamental symmetries to our
                    understanding of
                    the universe &mdash; Lorentz symmetry and CPT symmetry &mdash; are violated, however minutely, in the universe.
                </p>
                <p>Lorentz symmetry, in short, means that laws of physics would apply the same to objects no matter
                    where they are positioned in space, or if they are moving. This assumption is the basis of many
                    higher-level theories of physics, including relativity. If it were to be violated, these theories
                    would have to be critically rethought.</p>
                <p>The slightly more complicated CPT symmetry surrounds charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P) and
                    time reversal (T). This means antimatter, or particles with their positions reflected, should follow
                    the same laws of physics as the standard matter making up our bodies, the earth and all known
                    objects. The laws of physics should also apply both forward and backwards in time.</p>
                <p>Together, these symmetries are linked by CPT theorem, which says in theories of physics where Lorentz
                    symmetry applies, CPT symmetry must also apply. If one is violated, the other may be as well. </p>

                    around mass, like a bowling ball would shift the surface of a trampoline. The bowling ball would end
                    up in the center, creating a valley which would make other objects placed on the trampoline fall
                    toward it. In real life, this distortion involves the three spacial dimensions as well as the
                    dimension of time.</p>

                <p>For example, in Matthew McConaughey&rsquo;s voyage into space in the movie &ldquo;Interstellar,&rdquo; traveling near
                    the black hole causes McConaughey to end up significantly younger than his daughter on earth. By
                    traveling extremely fast and experiencing the immense gravitational force of a black hole onto
                    spacetime, he experiences &ldquo;less&rdquo; time.</p> 
                 
                <p>However, the IUCSS is not sure Lorentz and CPT symmetries, and relativity by extension, are airtight.
                    As an example, Snow once again brought up Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity, which filled in gaps left
                    by Isaac Newton&rsquo;s prior theory of gravity. </p>
                <p>Newton&rsquo;s theory had one small problem: Mercury&rsquo;s orbit had a small deviation from its expected path.
                    According to Snow, scientists dismissed this concern until Einstein combined space and time as one
                    unified body with relativity. </p>
                <p>Einstein was convinced relativity was right, Snow said, because his theory predicted that small
                    deviation of Mercury&rsquo;s orbit. The differences between the predicted orbits were minute, and yet the
                    difference between the theories was massive.</p>

                <h3>Looking for violations in experimentation</h3>
                <p class="dropcap">Just as Einstein&rsquo;s theory was confirmed by such a small observation, the IUCSS looks
                    for signs of
                    Lorentz and CPT violations on unbelievably small scales. In physics, symmetry has been recognized as
                    very important, but violations have been found in other areas outside the center&rsquo;s realm of study.
                </p>
                <p>Parity (P in CPT) is known to be violated as is time reversal in some processes, Ralph Lehnert, a
                    senior research scientist and associate director at the IUCSS, said. </p>
                <p>Lehnert works in phenomenology, meaning he uses the Standard Model Extension to make predictions or
                    phenomena, for experiments. Based on his findings, he projects certain results for experimentalists
                    like Snow to find in their experiments if violations are found, though the symmetries and relativity
                    have held up so far outside of the margin of error.</p>
                <p>They test out these potential violations in ways too numerous to list, but luckily for the
                    researchers, the SME provides all possible violations under their model. Lehnert said this is
                    possible because the theory works within mathematical principles the SME abides by&mdash; constraining the
                    number of violations possible in the theory.</p>
                <p>For example, in many science fiction series, spaceships use antimatter as fuel under the idea that
                    gravity would make antiparticles &ldquo;fall&rdquo; upward. However, a recent <a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/27/science/physics-universe-antimatter.html"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiment</a> at CERN proved gravity
                    makes both antiparticles and particles fall, upholding CPT theorem&rsquo;s assertion that gravity would
                    affect antimatter the same as matter while also crushing sci-fi fans&rsquo; dreams.</p>

                    <div class="ad-block">

                <p>Snow said their experimental research also involves measuring gravitational waves, which some
                    processes, such as black hole mergers, can observably cause. Accepted theory, Snow said, predicts
                    the speed of gravitational waves traveling across space should be the same as the speed of the
                    light. Though it currently looks like they do travel at the same speed, this has yet to be precisely
                    confirmed.</p>

                <p>In these experiments, neutrons held in the nucleus of an atom alongside protons with the <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3nGE8Z3-lo" target="_blank"

                        nuclear force</a>, are exploded away from the nucleus. They are then guided to collisions with
                    cold
                    material, slowing them down enough to make a beam, which they then manipulate. One common experiment
                    often done to poke at general relativity, Snow said, is measuring clocks in space due to their
                    precision.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Measuring time is one of the most precise things we know how to do, because ultimately all you have
                    to do is count,&rdquo; Snow said.</p>
                <p>In this experiment, clocks are lined up and compared to what relativity calculates their measurements
                    should be. If discrepancies between the clocks are credibly found, a violation of Lorentz or CPT
                    could be causing it.</p>
                    <!--Atomic clocks in space gif side-by-side-->
                <p>Teppei Katori, a former IUCSS graduate student who studies ultra-high energy neutrinos at King&rsquo;s
                    College in London along with many members of the IUCSS, focuses much of his research on one of the
                    most unusual particles known in the universe: the neutrino. </p>
                <p>Roughly 100 trillion of them pass through your body every second, and yet they are extremely
                    difficult for scientists to catch and measure. Neutrinos pass through solid matter almost as if it
                    were empty space &mdash; making them extremely difficult to catch and measure. The IceCube neutrino
                    observatory at the South Pole, the largest in the world, only detects <a

                    that could be influenced
                    by Lorentz or CPT symmetry violations. Many scientists affiliated with the IUCSS and the search for
                    violations devote their lives to studying these particles with almost endless opportunity for
                    discovery.</p>

                <p>Though no violations have been found yet in their decades of searching, if one is proven to exist,
                    the consequences would be enormous. Modern physics revolves around Lorentz and CPT symmetry, meaning
                    any discovery could have the potential to reshape the very foundation of physics.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We would be shocked and everyone in physics would be shocked, because these symmetries are the
                    foundation of how we think about space and time,&rdquo; Snow said.</p>
                <p>Light, a vexing phenomenon produced by photons that act as <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1yIApZtLos" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">particle and wave</a>, could be explained
                    through violations of Lorentz and CPT symmetry. Through invisible relativity-violating vectors in
                    space oscillating, light could be generated as a consequence, though the center has not been able to
                    test this out.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>&ldquo;We seem to have a different idea of what light is every century,&rdquo; Snow laughed. &ldquo;This could be one
                    of them.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>It could be seen in other actions too, including apples potentially falling at minisculely different
                    rates depending on where the Earth is positioned around the sun.</p>
                <p>All this leaves scientists at the IUCSS, including Snow, without much sleep at night. Between
                    watching computer simulations, writing on chalkboards and sheets of paper scattered around desks,
                    the research never stops.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working,&rdquo; Snow laughed. &ldquo;I am having a blast trying to break these laws, so I try to devote my
                    efforts to that goal. But there are only 24 hours in a day.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Snow said the possibility of not discovering any violations doesn&rsquo;t discourage his team. The
                    potential of finding a violation and revolutionizing physics, and their daily work of fleshing out
                    the field of physics, keeps them going. </p>
                <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re excited to try,&rdquo; Snow said. &ldquo;You attack a fundamental idea, you have no idea if
                    you&rsquo;re going to succeed and discover something or not, but that doesn&rsquo;t deter us. We&rsquo;re stubborn."
