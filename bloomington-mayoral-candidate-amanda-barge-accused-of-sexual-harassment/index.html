              <p class="caption" style="text-align: left;">Brandon Drake sits in his Bloomington home March 19. He alleges that 2019 Bloomington mayoral candidate Amanda Barge sexually harassed him for over a year.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Brandon Drake, 42, alleges Barge repeatedly expressed feelings for him and asked him to date her beginning in fall 2017. Drake said that after harassing him for months, Barge ultimately played a significant role in dismantling the project he worked on for Monroe County.</p>

            

            <p>Her actions, he said, forced him out of his professional community and left him feeling isolated from his colleagues.</p>

            <p>“She took away a year of my life,” he said in an interview.</p>

            <p>Documents and recordings Drake provided to the Indiana Daily Student show Barge, 46, seeming to admit that she repeatedly crossed a professional line.</p>

            <p>Drake gave the IDS hours of recorded conversation between himself and Barge and hundreds of other instances of communication including text messages, emails, Facebook messages and a Google note.</p>



            <p>After the IDS approached Barge about the allegations, she released a statement that called Drake a “disgruntled former Health Department contractor who has chosen to take public and private communications out of context to further his personal and political agenda.”</p>

            <div class="wide-right-text border-top">

            </div>

            <p>Apart from denying she would ever engage in harassment, Barge’s statement did not address specific allegations in this story, which were outlined to her in a meeting Monday.</p>



            <p>Barge became angry and shut Drake out professionally when he refused to date her, he said. Texts and emails show he told her he might also have feelings for her in July, but later said her advances made him uncomfortable.</p>

            

            <p>Drake said he felt he could not deny her advances because of his position.</p>



            <p>&ldquo;I was scared that she could destroy my career,&rdquo; he said in an interview.</p>

            <p>He told Barge something similar.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;When you come onto me over and over again with the power that you have in your hands it can be very scary for me,&rdquo; he wrote to her in an Aug. 2, 2018, email. &ldquo;We have a lot tied up with our work in the community.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>She was married at the time she was allegedly pursuing Drake but told him she was getting divorced. On Aug. 15, 2018, she told him she was legally divorced. She was not.</p>

            <p>Drake said he has experienced substance use disorder throughout his life. While struggling with addiction in 2004, he was arrested for battery. The charges were later dismissed. He also pleaded guilty to invasion of privacy in 2006.</p>

            <p>He has worked as a drug and alcohol interventionist, recovery coach and public speaker. He founded Keystone Interventions Group and co-founded Courage to Change, a group of sober living houses in Bloomington and Ellettsville, Indiana.</p>

            <p>Drake speaks around central and southern Indiana about surviving sexual abuse as a child and how that kind of trauma links directly to addiction. His past, he said, exacerbated the distress Barge’s actions caused him.</p>

            </div>

            <p>He said Barge had heard him speak about the abuse he endured as a child before the alleged harassment began. When he speaks about childhood trauma, Drake references his own childhood experiences of being raped by men and molested by women.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The thing about a brain that&rsquo;s been through trauma is it doesn&rsquo;t take the same shit it takes a person who doesn&rsquo;t have that to trigger some kind of episode,&rdquo; he said in an interview. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a trained therapist. She should&rsquo;ve known better.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Drake started off as a supporter of Barge and her work. He wanted her to be mayor. Then, he said, the advances began.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The thing is I was fucking praying she was who she said she was,&rdquo; he said in an interview. &ldquo;I really believed in the Amanda Barge mission.&rdquo;</p>

            <p class="section-break">***</p>

            <p>Barge convinced Drake to spearhead <a class="story-link" href="https://www.mcpathways.com/" target="_blank">Pathways</a>, a helpline for people struggling with addiction in Monroe County, he said, after he spoke at the first South Central Opioid Summit in September 2017. </p>

            <p>Drake left his job as an intervention and recovery coach to start working with the county to structure Pathways in October 2017. Barge told him she was confident she could get enough grant money to fund Pathways, he said.</p>

            <p>He alleges she also promised she could give him job security when she was mayor.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;She was always dangling that over my head,&rdquo; he said in an interview.</p>

            <p>Barge first told Drake she had feelings for him in November 2017, he said. He told her he didn’t date married women. Looking back, he now says he should have been more clear that he specifically did not want to date her.</p>

            <p>Less than a month later, Drake said, Barge told him she was getting a divorce. </p>

            <p>Barge’s campaign website read, “Amanda is a mom, a wife, a gardener and loves hanging out on her porch with her family!” at the time of publication.</p>

            <p>Donyel Byrd, an adjunct professor for the IU School of Social Work, said Drake first told her about what he then called “Amanda’s crush on him” near the beginning of 2018.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;My very first thought was, &lsquo;This is not going to end well,&rsquo;&rdquo; Byrd said. &ldquo;It went from bad to worse.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Byrd is a colleague of Drake’s. She said it’s been difficult to watch Barge gain so much support from Bloomington’s social work community after hearing Drake’s allegations.</p>

            <p>Drake said the next time Barge told him how she felt was over the phone around December 2017, while she was in Indianapolis. When he rejected her, he said she told him he had too many rules in his sex life.</p>

            <p>He alleges she also told him she was in love with him during that conversation.</p>

            <p>Around February 2018, Drake said, she began accusing him of having sex with some of their mutual acquaintances and colleagues. Byrd said she remembers Drake telling her that Barge accused him of having sex with his therapist.</p>

            <p>Drake denies Barge’s accusations.</p>

            <p>He said Barge also began acting jealous of women he spent time with and showing up at events he spoke at outside of Monroe County. This, he alleges, continued for months.</p>

            <p>“Every time I spoke or did anything she was right there,” he said in an interview. “I felt like it was to watch me.”</p>

            <p>She sent strings of texts and Facebook messages that Drake ignored until business required that he respond. Her messages ended with things such as “That’s all I’m gonna say, promise!” and “I’ll totally give you space and this too shall pass.”</p>

            <p>One day, when a volunteer for Pathways wore a dress Barge thought was inappropriate, Drake said she threatened to report the volunteer to the board of social workers. He said he believes this was out of jealousy.</p>

            <p>After he told her to stop threatening his staff, he said, things got a little bit better.</p>

            <p>Then, in July 2018, Drake was in contract negotiations with the Monroe County Health Department, which owed him money. Barge, he said, was critical to helping him get paid at the time.</p>

            <p>On July 26, 2018, just days before a meeting with the health department over the money, Barge texted Drake asking him again to date her.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not legally divorced but I am functionally divorced,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I feel like you and I have a good connection and I&rsquo;d like to see where it goes.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Though she texted that there was no pressure and she was just seeking clarity, Drake said it made him feel powerless and cornered. He said he had by now asked her to stop at least twice.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I woke up that morning laying in bed thinking I&rsquo;d have to have sex with her,&rdquo; he said in an interview. &ldquo;You never know what it&rsquo;s like until the day comes that you might have to have sex with the person you&rsquo;re disgusted by.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>This was the time Drake told Barge he might also have feelings for her. He said he did that to buy himself time. After he texted her back, she sent him 12 messages with no reply. </p>

            <p>Byrd said she was worried Drake’s emotional state during that time had deteriorated so severely that he might start using drugs again.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I was very concerned that his life could be in danger,&rdquo; she said.</p>

            <p>Pathways, Drake said, was crumbling as he fought for grant funding to keep it going. The grants that paid Drake’s salary only lasted through August 2018. When the program started, he said, Barge told him they would find more funding when August rolled around. That didn’t happen.</p>

            <p>“Pathways was dead by August,” Drake said in an interview.</p>

            <p>Monroe County attorney Dave Schilling said the county and health department both had some difficulties getting Drake to fulfill his contractual obligations.</p> 

            <p>“We were not happy with his performance,” Schilling said.</p>

            <p>Schilling said Drake was not fired and didn’t resign, but the agreement to end the contract was mutual.</p>

            <p>With his program gone, Drake was out of a job.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;To some people, it may seem inconsequential, but to him, that&rsquo;s his income,&rdquo; Byrd said of Pathways&rsquo; downfall. &ldquo;It was the only thing he had.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>After going without income for months, Drake now works for a book publishing company and runs a halfway house for men.</p>

            <p>In September 2018, Drake emailed an attorney asking for advice. He said Barge was still inserting herself into his life.</p>

            <p>She was, he said, trying to join the board of a halfway house he founded, showing up unannounced at his out-of-town speaking engagements and more.</p>

            <p>Byrd said she remembers seeing Barge become more connected with Drake&rsquo;s friends, acquaintances and professional contacts on social media during this time.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It was creepy,&rdquo; she said.</p>

            <p>Drake heard from a friend that Barge was telling people she had to stop working with him because he was unsteady and unreliable.</p>

            <p>In reality, he said, he had stopped attending meetings where he might run into her.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;She was passing me off as a crazy person,&rdquo; he said in an interview. He said he believes she was trying to create an environment where no one would believe him if he ever went public with his allegations.</p>

            <p>He said his story might be perceived differently if he was a woman. He often brings that up when telling friends about his time working for the county.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;How many times does someone get to approach you for romance or sex?&rdquo; he asked in an interview. &ldquo;Imagine I was a female dealing with this. Most people would get it.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>He paused.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I did not want this.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>On Aug. 15, 2018, Barge told Drake his harassment allegations made her decide to not run for mayor. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;I know I shouldn&rsquo;t put this in writing but so be it,&rdquo; she wrote in an Aug. 16, 2018, email where she analyzed their personal and professional relationship and why she thought things ended the way they did.</p>

            <p>She met Drake at a Steak &lsquo;n Shake on Aug. 15, 2018. While he recorded their conversation, they went over and over the times she expressed her feelings for him. </p>

            <p>Drake said an attorney told him federal employee discrimination law did not apply to him because he was an independent contractor &mdash; not an employee &mdash; and therefore was not offered sexual harassment protections.</p>

                Subject: Follow Up<br>
                To: Brandon Drake</p>
                <p class="email-line">Hi Brandon,</p>
                <p class="email-line">I know I shouldn’t put this in writing but so be it. Do what you need to do —I hope this follow up to what I said yesterday helps.</p>
                <p class="email-line">When I recently told you I had feelings for you it stemmed from your message to me about timing and how you said I was a catch and it was bad timing.  I started thinking about that and allowed myself to think about us in a different way.</p>
                <p class="email-line">You actually had said to me that you let the health department shit go and you seemed to be in a good place. Regardless of what I thought you were not. And most importantly, I let myself down, Monroe County government and people in this community including you by sharing my feelings w you. I was wrong and should never have done that. I do realize now that the day I told you was the same day as your meeting. Obviously that was dumb on my part.</p>
                <p class="email-line">I hate that you think I wasn’t there for you in meetings when I tried very hard to be. Had I known how important it was to you to be at that last one I would have. Maybe you told me it was and I didn’t catch that. You need to know though that my kids always come before work and I hadn’t had quality time w them and it was crucial. My kids needed me more this summer than in the past for obvious reasons.</p>

                  <div class="email-line">
                    <p>There were some meetings I didn&rsquo;t attend Brandon because I was trying to set boundaries at work. Like ones w you and Jeff. Since I had removed myself from voting on anything to do w you it would have been inappropriate to attend every meeting. I had to set professional boundaries at work. It would actually be highly suspect for me to attend every meeting given that I abstained from voting on anything pathways related. Like approving the contract-I since I abstained I didn&rsquo;t sign. I do take these things seriously. I thought I told you that but maybe I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

                    <p> I take full responsibility for hurting you. I know that my actions set this situation in motion and we are where we are now because of what I said to you. That isn&rsquo;t the entire reason our friendship has to end but I know that my actions set the wheels in motion.</p>

                    <p>Since we disagree about November and you said you saved my texts I&rsquo;d be happy to read them if you send me screen shots or call me and read them to me. I recognize that I may be wrong on this. I deleted all my texts from you during that time. But I do know that I would never ever ever be mad at someone for not sharing my feelings. Disappointed yeah. But getting angry isn&rsquo;t appropriate. Maybe I was frustrated about the way the convo went. You and I had many intense convos and some that turned to fights. Maybe it started w me saying that and ended up in a fight which is understandable why you would think I&rsquo;d become angry. I am open to being shown my perspective is wrong and if so please show me so I can learn from it.</p>

                    <p>I had terrible boundaries with you. That hurt me and probably you too. I walked right into a situation and had horrible boundaries. I won&rsquo;t do that again.</p>

                    <p>The dark part of our friendship won&mdash;I will absolutely miss what we had and it sucks. I wish that hadn&rsquo;t happened. </p>

                    <p>I woke up today and I feel free. I know you said you wouldn&rsquo;t pursue anything legal and I will choose to believe you. If you do, I would sincerely not want to live anymore knowing I let so many down. I let down a lot of people with my actions and I would never want my kids to know their mom had been accused of horrible things. I&rsquo;m sure you think I&rsquo;m not going to do anything bad to myself but I have layers and almost no one knows all the parts of me and yeah you said there is something wrong w me and you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m fucked up. You don&rsquo;t need me in your life.</p>

                    <p>  I think you and I both met at the worst possible times in our lives and hurt each other. Yeah we helped each other too. And sadly, the darkness won. And I won&rsquo;t debate you that there is something wrong w me. I never said I was easy or had it all together. And really if you decide to share this email or anything w anyone so be it. I am being honest so fuck it. </p>

                    <p>What I have realized after our conversation last night is that we were both in crisis when we met. We both got needs met from each other &mdash;comfort, validation, support. Good things. But I should have had the sense to know that you were really vulnerable and so was I and that was a recipe for disaster. You&rsquo;re still vulnerable and so am I. The fact that we both jumped head in to working together and being best friends was ridiculous. I saw red flags and ignored them. I blame myself for that too. Not you. I don&rsquo;t blame you &mdash;your journey is yours and mine is mine. Two vulnerable people should not intertwine like that and I should have taken responsibility for my part in going head first into things and just slowed down.</p>

                    <p> I&rsquo;m ending our friendship not because of you but because of me. I don&rsquo;t blame you. I&rsquo;m not a good friend for you and I&rsquo;m not capable of being one. A good friend would have recognized what a tough place you were in and anticipated how those texts might be received. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you anymore. It kills me not to be your friend and I meant what I said that you were amazing to me and helped me through tough times. And even the last few months while they have been terrible for you we had some fun. I will totally miss that. We had a special way of connecting and it was super fun and made me happy. And I liked making you happy too.</p>

                    <p> Note that above I took full responsibility. Until last night I didn&rsquo;t know the timing was so horrible for you. Now I know and if we had talked we probably wouldn&rsquo;t be here right now. That shows how important it is for us to communicate w each other regularly about work so there aren&rsquo;t misunderstandings. I was absolutely listening to you last night in the restaurant. I heard every word and agreed on a lot of what you said. I didn&rsquo;t really freak out until the end.</p>

                    <p>As far as work, I&rsquo;ll fake it and I will be contacting you a lot over email feel free to text or email but please do respond. Not responding puts us in a weird place because I don&rsquo;t know where your head is. Thank you. I have no doubt that if we communicate we can work together. And much of this is temporary and we won&rsquo;t need to work together as much after September.</p>

                    <p>You have two contracts w the commissioners office. In terms of the summit, I need to know if you plan to invoice for the final $1500. I&rsquo;m asking because it appears you removed yourself from social media. And I haven&rsquo;t heard from you on the email I sent asking you what you wanted to do for the summit. If you want, you could send me an email listing the things you want to do or an email just letting me know if you plan to invoice us. Either way the ball is in your court. I&rsquo;d just like to know so I know how to communicate w you on that. I don&rsquo;t care either way what you decide. Obviously I want you to be really involved in the summit but if you do or don&rsquo;t decide to finish the contract I do not care. I just want to know so we can make sure all goes well.</p>

                    <p>Please if anything I said felt hurtful write back and check in. I don&rsquo;t want to contribute to any problems. Also feel free to write back. In fact I would welcome it. It&rsquo;s hard to detach from a best friendship quickly and I would appreciate your thoughts. I&rsquo;d like to know what you think. It would maybe help us move on.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;ll miss you oh so much, Amanda </p>

            <p>In October 2018, Drake emailed his attorney that Barge was still trying to involve herself in his business. </p>

            <p>In a Nov. 20, 2018, call, one week after Barge launched an exploratory committee to decide whether she would run for mayor, Drake asked her again whether she felt her actions could be interpreted as sexual harassment.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Do you really want to go down this road?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

            <p>She said she was going through a midlife crisis when she made advances toward him and &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t have let myself go there at all.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I never really thought of us having a power differential,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I get it now. We did.&rdquo; </p>

              Subject: what I read last night<br>
              To: Brandon Drake </p>
              <p>This is what I wrote and read to you last night. I think I made amends and owned my mistakes and thoughtfully tried to help you understand as best I could.  AB</p>

              <p>Thank you:</p>

              <p>1.Thank you for being the first person to help me get over my shame of getting divorced. You were always nonjudgmental no matter what I told you was going on w me. You were the first friend I was able to tell some really painful things and you were amazingly respectful and helpful.</p>

              <p>2. Thank you for letting me in and sharing your life with me. I know it isn&rsquo;t easy for you to do and I want you to know how much of an honor that was.</p>

              <p>3. Thanks for challenging me, inspiring me, and teaching me. Thanks for letting me into your professional world and even though we come from very different places you always treated me as a person of value. </p>

              <p>4. Thanks for having my back, being nice to my kids, and making me laugh a lot.</p>

              <p>5. Thanks for accepting me for me, being respectful when I made mistakes, and sharing your giant heart and soul with me.</p>

              <p>6. There are lots of moments in the last year that I am forever grateful to you for stepping up and helping me through. You will never fully know how thankful I am.   I&rsquo;m sorry:   I&rsquo;m sorry that I allowed what could have been a respectful, productive conversation about boundaries and where our friendship was to devolve. While I started off communicating clearly, it quickly went off the rails and made things so much worse. The feelings I had were genuine but I didn&rsquo;t express them at all how I wanted to and I know that was uncomfortable for you. I also drunk texted you one night and I just wish I could take that shit back. I&rsquo;m so sorry. </p>

              <p>When I first brought this up, you and I both talked about talking in person about it. That&rsquo;s what I wanted. When that didn&rsquo;t happen, and I felt ignored, I upped the ante and started texting things to try to get you to talk to me. Instead of letting it go and being patient, I wanted to have closure and a resolution but my actions caused the opposite. I took out my frustration of not being heard on you. I wish I had given you more space and been respectful of what you needed. I will work on patience.</p>

              <p>I&rsquo;m sorry I said hurtful things. I can&rsquo;t go backwards but I can go forwards. I&rsquo;m sorry I said what I said about needing to protect myself when there were better ways to say it. I&rsquo;m sorry I indirectly called you a coward and I&rsquo;m sorry for any other hurtful things I said that I have overlooked. I wish I had been a better friend and conveyed to you that I wanted us to be okay even if we weren&rsquo;t for awhile we would eventually figure it out. I tried to explain that via text and it came out totally wrong and I couldn&rsquo;t take it back.  I am sorry for anything I did over the last year that led you to believe I wasn&rsquo;t genuine in my platonic love for you or that I would somehow use the miniscule amount of power I have to hurt you. I am sorry if any action I took made you feel that way. Even if we aren&rsquo;t friends moving forward and we just work together, I would use any power I have to help you, not hurt you.   Over a year ago, when I sat down w/ you at Starbucks I felt chemistry with you immediately. Not sexual but friend chemistry. I also immediately felt and still feel admiration and respect for you and where you have been, how smart you are, and how willing you have always been to let me in and teach me about recovery and addiction. So often people in recovery are judgy of people who don&rsquo;t have firsthand experience and I get why&mdash;they are judged by the rest of the world all the time and stigma&#8230;but you were always immediately giving and nonjudgmental or critical with me. It made me want to learn more from you so I could be a better advocate. So right away I felt an intellectual and spiritual connection to you. I also felt like I met someone likeminded. We seemed to agree on so much and it was so great to have a partner in crime. </p>

              <p>Last august, A YEAR AGO, I was not sure I was getting divorced. So much has changed for me. A year ago, my connecting w/ you was something I hadn&rsquo;t had in a long time&mdash;an emotional connection w/ a man. I missed that so much. I&rsquo;m not surprised that I was somewhat physically attracted to you &ndash; I&rsquo;m attracted to a lot of people and could connect with a wall. It&rsquo;s just who I am. But what was confusing to me is that we were going so deep emotionally. I kind of had a high on a spiritual level from our conversations and it was awesome. So when I felt attracted to you I got scared and instead of waiting for it to pass, as it did, I told you about it. That was purely selfish on my part. I needed to set boundaries and I wasn&rsquo;t worried about how what I was saying would impact you, I was totally wrapped up in my own brain then. </p>

              <p>In no way did I tell you thinking that something would happen. At that time in my life, I was wrapping up 5 years of feeling like a total failure at relationships and my self esteem was super low. I sincerely just needed you to tell me I'd be okay because you had a calming effect on me. </p>

              <p>I told you that day that I couldn&rsquo;t&rsquo; late night text anymore because married people shouldn&rsquo;t regularly late night text and flirt. That same evening, you texted me and we texted that night. Even though I tried to set a boundary, you didn&rsquo;t follow it and neither did I. I think you were a good innocent distraction at that time. I needed that. </p>

              <p>That October, I met a political consultant at a fundraiser dinner and we started texting. It escalated quickly and we knew were going to be at the same conference in Indy and it was clear we were going to hook up. It was a super confusing time since I had been married for 18 years and I am a totally loyal person and what I was doing didn&rsquo;t really fit w/ my values. I was in denial a lot and was being really secretive again not who I am. In November, someone in the Auditor&rsquo;s office asked if you and I were sleeping together. This was someone I trusted but it totally freaked me out. </p>

              <p>I remember telling you about it for the sole purpose of thinking we might need to be careful in public because even though there was zero truth to it, people are nosey and assholish. I also told you in that convo that it was confusing sometimes because you were cute and charming. To be clear: I believe that I said this to you because I was feeling guilty about my behavior in general and I was pretty sure my love of flirting caused people to think something about us. 100 percent the truth at that moment in time I thought you were cute and charming, flirty and fun but it was totally innocent and I knew it. What wasn&rsquo;t innocent were my other life choices and rather than face my complicated feelings about my marriage and the fact that I was about to cheat on John, I created a distraction w/ you. There is nothing deeper or more complicated. I wasn&rsquo;t in love with you, or anyone and I didn&rsquo;t really like myself and who I was being although now I have totally forgiven myself. </p>

              <p>After that convo, we were talking on the phone as I was packing for my conference in Indy. We got into a fight. I said something smart ass and you got mad and called me a victim and manipulative. After we hung up, I lost it and sent you a bunch of shitty texts and you basically told me we were taking space. I ended up having a great time at the conference and finally sleeping w/ someone else really clarified a lot for me, including that my friendship with you was super important. I missed it so much. As weird as it may sound, I wanted to call you and tell you how happy I was to have slept w/ someone and how it was freeing. But I couldn&rsquo;t call you bc we weren&rsquo;t speaking. Even then you were so important to my well being. I really felt your support got me through that time. </p>

              <p>I am very sorry that I added drama to our friendship during those months&mdash;I put our friendship at risk when I had confused feelings and rather than just own that I was confused in general I acted out instead of going inward. I look back though and those times helped me process what was going on. So I&rsquo;m sorry if it was hard for you and I&rsquo;m sorry that I made things hard for you. </p>

              <p>You should also know that I kiss and hug my friends, flirt w/ them and compliment them all the time. After November I was afraid to be myself fully w/ you and that&rsquo;s sad but I didn&rsquo;t want you to think I was hitting on you. I was overly careful not to send any mixed messages. I tried to be mindful of things I said so we didn&rsquo;t go back down that road or I didn&rsquo;t say something I didn&rsquo;t mean or make you uncomfortable. I wish I could have just been myself w/ you more but I was afraid it would hurt our friendship. I was always careful to try to protect that. I say this to you because of your accusations of harassment and not really being your friend. The reality is that I was trying to be over cautious and didn&rsquo;t even want to touch you accidentally.    Fast forward 8 months from November to July. I feel like during this time we got super close as friends. We went through a lot of ups and downs together and I changed so much both inside and out and the person I am right now is much more grounded. I am so thankful that you let me in and worked on trusting me. I know it&rsquo;s a challenge for you and there were many times you struggled and you never gave up on our friendship. That meant so much. </p>

              <p>What C. said about you thinking I was in love w you and that I only did things for you bc of that really hurt. It hurt that you would question my motives and that you told C. private conversations about personal stuff that involved me. It was embarrassing because I thought we were passed all that so hearing that from someone else me feel stupid. I&rsquo;m glad I called you immediately and you made me feel better about it. Then you sent me a sweet message telling me I should date and that any man would be lucky to have me. For the second time, you brought up how in the past when I shared my feelings it was bad timing so it made me start thinking that maybe our timing was better now. </p>

              <p>I just observed for awhile and didn&rsquo;t say anything. When I finally did say something, I told you that I had felt a connection and wanted to get some clarity. Your immediate response was that you had felt a connection too and had backed out of talking about it to me about it a few times out of a fear of losing our friendship. I took that to mean that you had similar feelings to me. You asked me about hanging out and seemed to agree we could talk in person. I genuinely believed that even if you were uncomfortable talking to me about it, you would show up because we show up for each other. I have sacrificed my feelings when you have accused me of pretty shitty things and have accepted that it was just your brain&rsquo;s way of working through stuff but when I made you uncomfortable you just disappeared. At least that&rsquo;s how I felt then and yeah it made me upset. Whether or not it was rational to be upset, I don&rsquo;t know but I do know you almost instantly tried to make it about me punishing you for not dating me which is insulting to me. And it diminishes all the trust I&rsquo;ve tried to build w/ you over the year and it just hurts because suddenly I&rsquo;m not your friend anymore. I am an enemy capable of terrible things. And there is nothing to be done about it. Nothing I can say seems to help.</p>

              <p>If we had talked in person and you&rsquo;d said no, I would have been disappointed. Not heartbroken or mad. I would have eventually been thankful to you for being so committed to our friendship because what we had was really special. </p>

              <p>I&rsquo;m super sorry I freaked you out w/ all my texts. I felt ignored and just persisted when I should have retreated. I made things worse. I know this. FWIW, I never just wanted to sleep w/ you. I was drunk when I said that. In fact, the thought of that terrifies me a little since we are so close. I value what we had which is why I wanted to talk in real life and sort through it. I think you wanted to keep things the same and I wanted to see if what we had might grow into something. I respect you and accept that.</p>

              <p>In the past two weeks, I have come to realize that what you want is a platonic girlfriend. You want a woman who can fulfill your innermost emotional needs, hang out, be in contact throughout the day and give each other advice. You wanted me to approve of all of your decisions and were always worried about letting me down. I kind of wanted the same thing and I enjoyed what we had. I think what we had was good. But it was kind of like a relationship without romance. </p>

              <p>Part of the reason that I spoke up about my own feelings and recognizing a connection beyond just a normal friendship was that I had started dating. I knew once I met someone that I was serious with things would have to change w/ us. Or if you met someone. I wouldn&rsquo;t talk to you late at night, because I&rsquo;d be w/ someone. There wouldn&rsquo;t be late night dog walks or good morning and good night texts or two hour phone convos with joking and laughter. The reality is that platonic relationships have to change once one of the people gets a boyfriend of girlfriend. I think our relationship was making it hard for me to move forward. I went on a date and spent half the night texting you and thinking about how much more fun you and I have together. </p>

              <p>I don&rsquo;t think either of us got what we wanted in this situation. I think we were both afraid of losing each other and acted out in different ways. I pushed you into a confrontational situation and you pushed me away. I came close and you slammed the door in my face. I pushed the door in and then you burned the door down and built a wall I couldn&rsquo;t get past. </p>

              <p>For that, I&rsquo;m sorry that I pushed you when you didn&rsquo;t want me to. I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t more patient. I should have been more respectful of our friendship and your needs.   You should know that being accused of harassment caused me to stop dating the person I was seeing. I have also decided not to run for mayor. I&rsquo;m not blaming you at all I just want you to know that I have not taken your accusation lightly. I also don&rsquo;t really know how to have a civil conversation with you about this &ndash; my wish is that someday we could go through texts together and try to understand each other better.</p>

              <p>I wish that you hadn&rsquo;t accused me of that. There have been many times I could have attacked you and I did not. I don&rsquo;t want to fight about this but I do want you to know that I have defended you and protected you even after you have said horrible things to me. I just ask that moving forward you not talk about this. If you think that&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t do, I will have no choice but to accept this. But know on my end I will never expose your secrets nor will I share with anyone things you have said. I never want you to worry about me sharing any secrets you&rsquo;ve told me because I won&rsquo;t.</p>

              <p>I hope we can work towards a friendship again even though it will look totally different. </p>

              <p>Again, I&rsquo;m sorry for my actions that caused you pain. I will work on having better boundaries w/ you and being a better human being. I love you.</p>

            <h5><b>Statement from Amanda Barge</b></h5>
            <p>“I am of course dismayed that anyone would make these accusations against me. Brandon Drake is a disgruntled former Health Department contractor who has chosen to take public and private communications out of context to further his personal and political agenda.</p>
            <p>There is no place for harassment in any workplace or anywhere in our community. I would never engage in or condone such activity. I, along with the other Commissioners, am committed to assuring all county employees of their right to work in a safe environment.</p>
            <p>If the essence of his complaint was truly about my professionalism and my position as County Commissioner, he could have raised it with the appropriate authorities and via the proper mechanisms a long time ago.</p>
            <p>Instead, he has chosen the heat of the primary to ambush me with a premeditated, spurious allegation based upon numerous conversations - some of which were surreptitiously recorded – and emails and texts over a period of a year.</p>
            <p>This is a complex situation. We live in a small community where professional relationships and friendships are often comingled. Brandon’s attempt to recover his tarnished reputation at my expense diminishes actual victims of sexual harassment.</p>
            <p>Despite this political attack, I remain deeply focused on compassionate leadership and providing meaningful opportunities that give people a second chance.</p>
            <p>If you or anyone you know is experiencing harassment in the workplace, please call: 800-656-HOPE”</p>
