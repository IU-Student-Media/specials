			<p>The decision to rename himself was that of Marlowe Shepherd and his Los Angeles-based executive producer, Derek Jones, who has backed Shepherd for the last 15 years. In a few months, Shepherd will embark on a 41-city, 250-show tour through the Southeast. He’ll do it again the next year. He will play in nursing homes, record stores, restaurants and bars, and he’ll perform two or three sets every day and one every night. Along the way, he’ll promote his self-titled  vinyl album.<a href="http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/10/musician-turns-to-touring-and-vinyl-as-primary-outlets" target="_blank"> Read more.</a></p>

			<p>Derby Sanchez doesn’t play the kickball you remember from elementary school recess. When the players take the field, it’s no longer just for fun and exercise. Every call matters and once the cans and bottles of beer get lighter, more arguing and trash talking is sure to follow. This form of kickball is still fun, but it’s a different sport.</p>
			<p>With Derby, it’s war.<a href="http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/12/undefeated-and-unapologetic" target="_blank"> Read more.</a></p>
