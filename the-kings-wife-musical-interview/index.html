                <p><strong>Sydney Weber:</strong> To get started, can you tell me a little bit about why you went with
                    the story of Catherine of Aragon for the musical?</p>
                <p><strong>Annis:</strong> The interesting thing is, I think it&rsquo;s easy to think that we&rsquo;re
                    just telling
                    another Tudor story. Right? There have been so many Tudor tales over the years. There&rsquo;s all of
                    these
                    other things, but I do feel a little bit like Catherine of Aragon gets short shrift. Partly because
                    of course, she was the first wife, and she was erased almost completely from the history book
                    because he (Henry VIII) needed to get rid of her so that he could move on. But people forget that,
                    actually, they were married for over 20 years.</p>
                <p>And so even though the majority of our fascination is with Anne Boleyn and with all of the horrific
                    deeds that he did &mdash; you know, the murder of the women after that &mdash; people forget that
                    actually, there was 20 years of his life that he was with this one woman. And so, a part of the
                    story that we&rsquo;re telling is: in that 20 years, who were they to each other at the beginning of
                    that
                    time? And then again at the end of that time that they had with each other? So, in 100 minutes,
                    we&rsquo;re spanning two decades. As you can imagine, only musical theater can do something like
                    that.</p>
                <p>Although we are using Catherine of Aragon as the vehicle to tell this story, we are using essentially
                    the archetype of familiar faces to reflect on our own society today. So, although it is the story of
                    Catherine of Aragon, and we do have Anne Boleyn entering the court, and of course we have the king
                    and all the things, trappings, that come with the Tudor court, we are essentially looking at history
                    through this musical reimagining of the story of Catherine of Aragon, so that we can look at who we
                    are today. (We&rsquo;re) using those archetypes to try and raise the mirror to some of the problems
                    we have in society, still, even though it&rsquo;s however many hundreds of years later, right?</p>
                <p>And then, of course, in our show, one of the things that was very important to us is that our story
                    is about the women that we never hear about, as opposed to the king that they share. So, they get to
                    take center stage and tell their own stories of power, ambition, sisterhood, heartbreak, hope, all
                    of that sort of stuff, you know?</p>

                        King's Wife" at Constellation Stage and Screen. The musical explores how Henry VIII's decision
                        to divorce Catherine of Aragon affected her and resulted in the creation of the Church of
                        England.

                <p><strong>Weber:</strong> Some of those problems of modern times that you alluded to are reflected in
                    the story. What are some of those that you were thinking about during development?</p>
                <p><strong>Annis:</strong> Well, I think that as an artist, our job is to constantly have our satellite
                    dishes open, our ears open, to what&rsquo;s happening, and sometimes we&rsquo;re not even aware of
                    what we&rsquo;re
                    writing until we&rsquo;re writing it. And so, it&rsquo;s been actually very, very interesting to
                    constantly be
                    developing this piece &mdash; because we've been developing it now over seven years, more or less.
                </p>
                <p>And so, things have come in and out of the musical, but the core of it remains, and that is that
                    sometimes the smartest person in the room is a woman, and she doesn't get the job. She gets the job
                    done, but she doesn&rsquo;t get the job, because she's not a man. So that essentially is a big core
                    part
                    of our story, which is: What is it about this sharing of power, this equitable power, that we
                    struggle with so much? That women are just not getting a portion of the pie? Because it&rsquo;s not
                    their
                    brains, it&rsquo;s not anything else other than choices that society makes to say 'no, no, no, no,
                    you
                    don&rsquo;t get a right to be at the biggest table&rsquo;.</p>
                <p>And so, it sort of looks at: Well, why is that? And why is it even as far back as 1513, that the most
                    extraordinary woman, from a dynasty of extraordinary people who did extraordinary things in Spain,
                    comes to England and essentially is not only sidelined but erased from much of our history? And so,
                    that is a big, big part of the story.</p>
                <p>And then, of course, there is this idea of, you know, how society treats the female body and freedom
                    of choice. And so, Anne Boleyn comes in with ideas that she can have some sort of freedom of choice.
                    And then she quickly realizes, &lsquo;Oh, we are here,&rsquo; for lack of a better word, &lsquo;to
                    birth an heir. That
                    is my role. And if I want to move forward in my role, I have to achieve this one thing, that I have
                    no power or control over, to give a male heir, to have a voice.&rsquo; And so, it all comes back to
                    this
                    idea of: Gosh, why is it one rule for one and another for another? It just, you know, it&rsquo;s the
                    constant question that we as women ask, I think in society: Why can&rsquo;t we all play by the same
                    rules?

                    process looked like?</p>
                <p><strong>Annis:</strong> Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of heartbreak. I actually wrote the script first. I
                    wrote
                    the play of it first, and then our producer
                    <a href="https://rosalindproductions.com/the-team/" target="_blank">
                        Jennifer Kranz</a> with Rosalind Productions, she discovered
                    Jamie&rsquo;s work.
                    <a href="https://www.officialjamiefloyd.com/bio" target="_blank">
                        Jamie Floyd</a> is a Nashville writer. She writes a lot of great songs for a lot of great
                    people. What Jamie does so beautifully is she&rsquo;s a wonderful storyteller, but she also captures
                    the
                    emotion of a moment so beautifully, and with a hook. So, we discovered that, gosh, we can really
                    push this feeling of a contemporary retelling of a story using Jamie&rsquo;s superpower, which is
                    pulling
                    at the heartstrings.
                </p>
                <p>Jamie and I really just kind of spoke to each other about &lsquo;Well, what are the things that are
                    important to us, for us to say?&rsquo; And Jamie and I are very, very different women. You couldn't
                    get two more different people if you tried it, she and I. And yet we came together on this feeling
                    of, we both know what it is to be marginalized in rooms. We both know what it is to try and have to
                    speak up for ourselves when others perhaps have a much louder voice and can step on ours. So, we
                    have these similar experiences, and we just basically played in the sandbox from there on.</p>
                <p>With us working with each other for a little while, the pandemic hit, and that was very hard because
                    I was in New York City and she was in Nashville. We experienced being separate and writing a musical
                    when you're that far away from each other and when you think the world is coming to an end. Our
                    respective industries closed down, hers being music and mine of course being theater; it was just a
                    very troubling time. And so, we really had to reassess once we sort of came back together:
                    &lsquo;Who are
                    we now?&rsquo; Because who we were pre the pandemic and who we were post the pandemic had shifted.
                </p>

                <p>And then we looked at the script and we thought: &lsquo;Well, that is exactly what these characters
                    have gone through.&rsquo; Huge shifts, you know, in their lives and huge traumas that they&rsquo;re
                    expected to
                    just move forward regardless. But actually, the world shifts with these major events. And so,
                    there&rsquo;s one moment in the first act, where Catherine of Aragon is &mdash; not to give too much
                    away
                    &mdash; but she is pregnant with her fifth child, and she still hasn&rsquo;t produced a male heir
                    for the
                    king. Of course, she has a beautiful young daughter who&rsquo;s perfectly capable of taking over the
                    throne, but she doesn&rsquo;t count. So, she&rsquo;s pregnant, she&rsquo;s late in her 30s at this
                    point and she
                    thinks that she probably won&rsquo;t make it through this last birthing.</p>

                        Emma Hunton (left), Andrew Keeler (center) and Ricky Moyer (right) act in a scene from "The
                        King's Wife" at Constellation Stage and Screen. The musical explores Henry VIII's attempts to
                        produce a male heir which creates tension between him and the musical's main character,
                        Catherine of Aragon.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>And so that moment in the musical became so clear to us that &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the shift in the
                    show.&rsquo; And so, we start at the beginning of the show in this crazy Tudor romp, where
                    it&rsquo;s
                    almost cartoon-like. The archetypes are at their fullest at the top of the show. And then at this
                    final loss of her final child, everything shifts, as if the reality hits. The world has changed, and
                    it&rsquo;s almost like we go into a sort of, for lack of a better word, almost like a grayscale
                    version of
                    the show, where they&rsquo;re all trying to figure out, how do they move forward from this moment?
                </p>
                <p>Our first reading was at Playwrights Horizons in New York City, and then we were lucky enough to be
                    able to go to the Adirondack Theatre Festival, after that. We had four performances with three
                    glorious days there of sold-out performances of another reading, which taught us so much about what
                    we were doing. Every time we have an audience, we learn so much. And then we were at Paramount just
                    a couple of months ago just outside of Chicago, in Aurora, Illinois, where we learnt again with a
                    new cast. And just being with Constellation in Bloomington for the last week has been the biggest
                    growing experience for the show, because now we&rsquo;re finally staging it for the first time. And
                    anybody of your readers who is a playwright, or musical theater writer, will know that you don't
                    know anything until you have bodies on stage, moving around. And so, Jamie and I have been deep in
                    rewrites every day this week. And we&rsquo;re so grateful for Constellation to give us this
                    opportunity to
                    play, form and to learn from your audiences here in Indiana.</p>

                <p><strong>Weber:</strong> How did it come about that it was going to be at Constellation and
                    Bloomington, Indiana for the world premiere of this musical?</p>
                <p><strong>Annis:</strong> Well, you guys have a great theater here. I think that there&rsquo;s this
                    very
                    elitist idea that theater only happens in New York City, and maybe occasionally in Atlanta and
                    California and of course, Canada. We don&rsquo;t want to have polarized audiences, right? And
                    it&rsquo;s so
                    helpful to actually take a story around, like the old troubadours used to do back in the day, to
                    take a story around and see what&rsquo;s resonating with different audiences. And you here in
                    Bloomington,
                    have such a great variety of audiences.</p>

                        Rong act in a scene from "The King's Wife." The musical, which opened at Constellation Stage and
                        Screen June 5, highlights the women of Tudor England and the roles they played in society.

                <p>So just looking at Constellation, you know, they're challenging people; they're putting entertaining
                    stories out there, as well as putting new ideas, putting new plays out there. And developing new
                    plays and developing new musicals is a difficult, difficult thing to do. Trust me, you don&rsquo;t
                    do it
                    for the money. And so, when Constellation approached us because we had said we had won the
                    <a href="https://seeconstellation.org/get-involved/submit-play" target="_blank">Woodward
                        Newman Prize</a> for the script, when they approached us to do the first production, we just
                    thought:
                    &lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly what we need to do. We need to learn.&rsquo; Chad, the artistic
                    director,
                    has been fantastic with giving us thoughts and notes and helping us realize this dream. It was one
                    of those things where all of the pieces came together at the right place at the right time. And that
                    place happened to be Bloomington, Indiana. And so, it&rsquo;s great for me as a woman from Wales who
                    has never been to Indiana; I get to experience a whole new part of the country, which is lovely.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Weber:</strong> Is there any way in which you can see how your background as a Welsh woman
                    has really influenced how the show came about or what it&rsquo;s like?</p>
                <p><strong>Annis:</strong> I think that politics is a very complicated thing, right? And international
                    politics are very complicated. However, when a producer came to me with this idea, the one thing I
                    knew I had in bucket loads was experience of being around the Tudors. Being born in Britain, you
                    know, we&rsquo;re surrounded by castles. It&rsquo;s a big part of our history. Everyone goes to
                    Hampton Court on
                    a school trip, and I&rsquo;ve probably been there six times at this point.</p>
                <p>Our whole show is actually set in the Great Hall. And the way that we've staged all the scenes
                    because, as you know, being in the Great Hall, there&rsquo;s all those eavesdroppers. There&rsquo;s
                    always
                    people listening. And there are doorways everywhere. It really has that feeling of &lsquo;you can't
                    have any private moments.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s someone listening at all times. And that was
                    something that
                    I really discovered in Hampton Court recently when I was there last year. Again, that it was a very
                    exciting thing, to never know who&rsquo;s listening.</p>
                <p>But to go back to your question, we are surrounded by Tudor history in Britain. And so that was a
                    very easy thing for me to plug into as a person. But I also have a bittersweet connection with the
                    Tudors too, because I am Welsh and they were Welsh. They were the last reigning Welsh royal family
                    that have been on the throne.</p>
                <p>But I think that that connection at least allowed me to think, as a Welsh person who&rsquo;s always
                    felt
                    somewhat colonized by the English, &lsquo;What is it to feel that precarious insecurity of: I need
                    to
                    secure something to prove my worthiness?&rsquo; And so, I really, really identified with that
                    feeling,
                    weirdly, that Henry had, of &lsquo;I need a son because I need an heir to continue the legitimacy of
                    my
                    life.&rsquo; And I think sometimes as a minority culture, you're constantly trying to prove
                    yourself. And
                    sometimes we do stupid things and sometimes we do great things, but sometimes we do stupid things
                    just to say, &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m worthy.&rsquo; And so that really spoke to me.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>But ultimately, what I was really interested in is once I sort of dove into the story of Catherine of
                    Aragon, was this woman who was born in a family that essentially ended up colonizing the world. And
                    the power that she had coming to England, which was a teeny tiny little country that was not yet an
                    empire and did not become an empire until Elizabeth the First, essentially. And so, just sort of
                    this idea of these extraordinary women from these extraordinary, powerful places that have been put
                    into, you know, big hoopskirts and caged and put into corners. When actually, we need to remember
                    that they were a big part of the history of not only America, but other countries, too, be it good
                    or bad, because it&rsquo;s very complicated. Just like I said, with my history of the Tudors,
                    it&rsquo;s very
                    complicated, but it is endlessly fascinating. And I think that&rsquo;s why the story remains, is
                    because
                    it is just endlessly fascinating to think, &lsquo;Gosh, we are repeating so many of the same things
                    in the
                    past. Why? Why is that?&rsquo;</p>
