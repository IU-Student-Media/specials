                        She climbs the shallow hill of the cemetery, walking slowly and carrying fresh flowers. At Plot
                        C43, she spreads a blanket and sits. She talks to her parents in front of their headstone. She
                        talks to her grandfather, buried just a few feet to the left. As always, she tries to talk to
                        her great-grandfather, Halson Vashon Eagleson Sr.

                    <p>
                        H.V. Eagleson doesn’t have a headstone at Rose Hill Cemetery. He’s one of many members of the
                        Eagleson family in C43 that aren’t marked, said Bridgwaters, his great-granddaughter.
                        Bridgwaters knows they’re buried there. But without headstones, it’s hard to know exactly who
                        she’s talking to sometimes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dignity in death isn’t universal, but it should be, the living say. Dignity can be embodied in a
                        headstone, a memorial to a life and a remembrance for the family members still here to think of
                        them. But this common decency hasn’t always been afforded to Black people like the Eaglesons.
                        Disproportionately, minorities are buried without tombstones in the United States. Many
                        financial and racist barriers often prevent Black people from obtaining the headstone — the
                        dignity — their families desire.

                        “When you have monuments, it speaks to the relevance of the person, of their life, of their
                        contribution, their legacy,” Bridgwaters said. “To have my great-grandfather’s monument would
                        speak to not just the Black community — which it would be uplifting for as well — but for
                        Bloomington as a whole.”

                        <figcaption>Vivian Bridgwaters, the great-granddaughter of H.V. Eagleson Sr., speaks about a family portrait Oct. 11, 2021, in her home in Bloomington. Eagleson's children made history at Indiana University by becoming the first Black IU athlete and the first Black IU female graduate. Eagleson Sr. himself was a prominent Black figure in the Bloomington community, owning his own barbershop in the heart of downtown. Bridgwaters has been speaking with the Monroe County Cemetery Committee since 2016 about getting a headstone for her great-grandfather.

                        Face west from Plot C43 and only a few dozen yards away is a stone for a Negro League baseball
                        star, recently added after 50 years without one. Turn to the east and there’s a Black
                        Revolutionary War veteran who went centuries without a headstone. They are some of the few
                        who’ve finally had remembrance afforded to them.

                        Most cemeteries have unmarked graves. Some have dozens, others hundreds. Old cemeteries like
                        Rose Hill have sold almost every plot, yet have large swathes of open space. The families of the
                        dead know their loved ones are buried there — tucked away beneath the ground without anything to
                        remember their lives or their deaths.

                        Cemeteries are often crowded this time of year. The holiday season reunites families. It’s a
                        time for celebration and happiness. But it’s a time for grieving, too.

                    <p>
                        And grieving is much harder when you know your loved one is buried with no marker.

                        No one knows exactly how many Black people are lying without a headstone across the country. It
                        is a national problem, and in recent years many groups have found or dug up these unmarked
                        graves.

                        In Tulsa, Oklahoma, over the last year, archeologists and forensic scientists have found a total
                        of 35 graves at a mass grave site in the Black portion of an Oklahoma cemetery. It is believed
                        those in the grave, who had been left unmarked, were killed in the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/tulsa-race-massacre-100-years-later-why-it-happened-why-n1268877" target="_blank">1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.</a>

                        Some Black people were buried without a marker to be hidden. There is purposeful forgetting — an
                        insidious form of racism, burying history without any recognition.

                        In southern Indiana, among the world’s largest producers of limestone, headstones are an art
                        form. There are obelisks and figurines and tree trunks to mark the dead. But limestone weathers
                        quickly compared to other rocks. Many westward-facing stones are hard to read after decades of
                        battering from eastbound winds.

                        When it first opened sometime between 1818 and 1820, Rose Hill Cemetery was just called the
                        “Grave Yard” — the main cemetery in town. It’s Bloomington’s second oldest cemetery, and many of
                        the town’s most famous citizens are buried there. The names carved there first on headstones
                        made of Indiana limestone now name the town’s streets. Dodds, Sample and Ballantine. Atwater,
                        Kirkwood and Rogers too.

                        The stories inside the cemetery detail the history of Bloomington and this nation, for better
                        and worse. Bloomington’s founders, all white men, were originally buried on Ninth Street. But
                        when a Black man was later buried there, their families had the founders bodies moved to Rose
                        Hill, local historian Tony Mitchell said. The stories date back to the Revolutionary War and
                        Andrew Ferguson, one of a small number of Black men to fight in the Colonial army — who,
                        unbeknownst to the founders’ families, was already buried at Rose Hill when the white founders
                        were moved there.

                        Despite all the different types of memorials, they all have a few things in common. They all
                        have a birth date and a death date. And they all have a dash between those dates. That dash,
                        Pastor Eddie Howard of Bloomington’s Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, said, is the
                        most important part of the stone. It’s what that dash represented — a life, no matter how long
                        or short, a life with memories all tied up in a little line.

                        Markers are memories, Howard said, and not everyone is so fortunate as to have anyone remember
                        them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We don’t keep memories alive for future generations,” Howard said. “A headstone is important;
                        it connects to a lot. Headstones are what gives them that life back. Without that, it’s like
                        they’re lost.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His own grandmother, buried in Alabama, didn’t have a headstone. With no place to visit her,
                        Howard said it was easy to forget the fact that she didn’t have a marked grave. With no place to
                        visit her, it was easy to forget his memories of her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And when his family finally got her a stone, Howard remembers hearing stories about his
                        grandmother he’d never heard before. The headstone brought back a lost life story.
                    </p>

                        But Howard didn’t know how many families had loved ones missing headstones quite like his own.
                        That fact brought tears to his eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the church’s sanctuary, Howard strolled along the wall, pointing out the names on the stained
                        glass. He hadn’t always paid attention to just what those names meant. So it was a look of shock
                        when suddenly, looking to the other side of the church, a newly familiar name was written in the
                        window.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “H.V. Eagleson Sr.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stained glass, in the back corner in one of Bloomington’s oldest sanctuaries, is H.V.’s only
                        current memorial.

                        There still isn’t a headstone.

                    <p>
                        H.V. isn’t a Bloomington native, but his history and his family’s history permeate the makeup of
                        this town.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are conflicting records, but Bridgwaters believes H.V. was born in Keokuk, Iowa, in 1851
                        and raised in an orphanage until he was 14. He later moved across the Great Plains and Midwest
                        before arriving in Chambersburg, Indiana. There, H.V. learned to be a barber and later moved his
                        family to Bloomington in the early 1890s, where he opened his own shaving parlor and provided
                        better educational opportunities for his children near Indiana University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Five of H.V.’s six children attended IU. One of those was Bridgwaters’ grandfather, Preston
                        Eagleson, the first documented Black athlete at IU. Starting in 1893, he played on the football
                        team. Preston became a beloved pastor at the AME church, and H.V. was ordained there before him.
                        And that’s why his name is in the sanctuary’s stained glass window.

                        Elizabeth Eagleson Bridgwaters, Preston’s daughter and Bridgwaters’ mom, was the first Black
                        woman elected in Monroe County, serving on the Monroe County School Board. Frances Marshall
                        Eagleson — namesake of IU’s Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center — was the first Black woman to
                        graduate from IU. She married Bridgwaters’ uncle, Wilson Vashon Eagleson. Wilson became a
                        football, basketball and baseball coach at North Carolina Central University, whose mascot is
                        now the Eagles, named after the Eagleson family. Frances’ and Wilson’s son Wilson II became a
                        Tuskegee Airman.

                        But it was H.V.’s barbershop — located back then near the intersection of Kirkwood and College
                        Avenues — that first brought the family fame in town.

                        “I knew that we were a prominent family,” Bridgwaters said. “But not a wealthy one.”

                    <p>
                        H.V. didn’t have the opportunity to pursue a job with higher wages than a barber. Prejudice over
                        the color of his skin prevented him. He mostly cut white people’s hair, Bridgwaters said. If he
                        did cut a Black client’s hair, white people would stop coming to the business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        H.V. would sometimes cut Black people’s hair after the shop was closed, but he had to use
                        different scissors. White people didn’t want their hair cut with the same tools.

                        The money H.V. made at the barbershop was saved for an orphanage. H.V.’s lifelong goal was to
                        open an orphanage after his own upbringing in one and help Black children in the Bloomington
                        area get an education. He opened his orphanage for Black children called Industrial City in
                        Unionville, Indiana, in 1910.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        H.V. died in 1921, beloved in Bloomington’s Black community. But his family wasn’t able to
                        afford a headstone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You don't think of barbers as being wealthy people,” Bridgwaters said. “But he was wealthy in
                        terms of his influence in the Black community.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Racism meant prominence didn’t equal remembrance. Bridgwaters always knew her great-grandfather
                        didn’t have a headstone. When she went with her mother, Bridgwaters didn’t remember him ever
                        having a stone. A 1976 Rose Hill record claims H.V. had a stone at that time, but if there was,
                        it has since disappeared.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are only three headstones in Plot C43, and they lay about 10 feet apart. One is an
                        Eagleson stone, with four names on it, including Preston and Vashon Jr. Another is a Bridgwaters
                        stone with three names, including Bridgwaters’ mom Elizabeth Eagleson Bridgwaters and father
                        Albert Louis Bridgwaters. And the final is a single, military-style stone for Walter V.
                        Eagleson, another of H.V. Sr.’s sons.

                        “It was always something that I wanted to see happen,” Bridgwaters said of getting a headstone.
                        “I thought it was an issue. And I had left the calendar on my coffee table. Just as a reminder
                        of something that I needed to follow up on and that I wanted to try and move forward.”

                    <p>
                        She called the Monroe County Cemetery Committee director in 2016, trying to become involved in
                        the effort to get H.V. a stone. The actual plans were unclear, but Bridgwaters was happy to at
                        least know there was an intention to get a memorial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, the committee director changed. The director has changed multiple times since 2016, and
                        the plan kept getting pushed off. Then COVID-19 hit and the Eagleson memorial was not a priority
                        until finally, in 2021, Scott Emery remembered the Eaglesons.

                        It was 9 a.m. and Scott Emery was an hour early, parked in his worn white Silverado. The truck
                        bed was full of shovels and history books, epoxy and brushes. But those could wait for now. He
                        walked around to check on the cemetery first. He wore hiking boots and a faded white Monroe
                        County History Center T-shirt, pointing out each broken or sunken stone — and the ones you can
                        only still see because of him.

                    <p>
                        “I kept going, ‘Somebody needs to do something about these,’” Emery said. “And then I realized I
                        was somebody.”

                    <p>
                        Emery is the chair of the Monroe County Cemetery Committee, a group of volunteers who take care
                        of the county’s cemeteries. On this Saturday morning, they were at Rose Hill, one of the group’s
                        first in-person meetings in months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    <p>
                        Their task that day was to enter the Spencer Addition, the oldest section of the cemetery, and
                        fix weathered and damaged headstones. Some stones had fallen over. Others had collected so much
                        dirt and lichen that they needed to be cleaned. Others still had sunken into the ground from the
                        weight of gravity and time.

                        Physical damage to stones can come from reckless lawnmowers or someone not carefully walking
                        through the grounds. Other damage can come from theft and landscaping.

                        Kathy Koontz, a volunteer, picked up a headstone and set it on a table. The name on the stone
                        was difficult to read. Older stones like this one can’t handle chemical cleaners, which risk
                        damaging them more. So she used water and a brush to clean, brushing a memory back to life.
                        Another volunteer dug up a sunken headstone and Emery filled the hole with new dirt and wood
                        planks to keep the stone upright above ground.

                        months. He often finds more history in doing so. Emery said he’s dug up Civil War artifacts and
                        children’s toys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s a never-ending task. Finish one round of cleaning and repairing the cemetery, and it will
                        be right about time to start all over again. There are never enough volunteers available to
                        handle the workload.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I get paid in satisfaction,” Emery said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emery joined the Committee in the 1990s and worked his way up over the last three decades to
                        become its leader. He said an effort like the one to create headstones for unmarked graves is
                        not common throughout the country — but it should be.

                    <p>
                        Many years on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Emery said he and other committee members would go to
                        Rose Hill to look for names of those they know are dead and buried there but who may not have
                        headstones. Emery found many large expanses of what he called “prime location” with just grass
                        and no headstone. But he knew the ground beneath him wasn’t empty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through those searches through the cemetery, the Committee found George Shively’s unmarked
                        grave. He became the group’s first fundraising project to purchase a headstone — giving dignity
                        in death for someone who had it withheld.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They call themselves The Dignity Project. The living, working to give memorials to the dead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rose Hill’s records report everyone buried there since 1897 and can help narrow down where a
                        person without a headstone might be buried, but without headstones, there’s still uncertainty.
                        There might be one headstone in that area, but 20 people beneath the ground, invisible to anyone
                        walking past.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Methods like ground-penetrating radar can reveal exactly where a person is buried. But that is
                        costly, and out of the committee’s budget.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Dignity Project relies on families to reach out to them requesting a memorial for their
                        loved one. There are so many unmarked graves, and by nature they are difficult to find.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So after years of the project getting pushed down the road, Emery was glad to get a call from
                        Bridgwaters about H.V.’s grave. He checked the Eagleson family plot and saw the few stones
                        there. But his eyes were drawn more to the open grass without anything to mark the bodies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Headstones are expensive, often costing more than $10,000. Replacing them is a challenge and
                        requires a large effort, often beyond what the small groups of volunteers can handle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s difficult to dig up these histories, to mark the missing lives. They’ll never attend to
                        every unmarked grave. There are too many of them. But Emery and his group of dignity seekers see
                        that as their own duty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s a privilege that should be afforded to anybody,” Emery said of the dignity a memorial
                        brings. “And it shouldn’t be limited by anything.”
                    </p>

                    <p class="dropcap">
                        Today, Bloomington is a small blue town in deep red southern Indiana. Many view Bloomington as a
                        progressive college town, but not everyone feels welcome here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1945, Black students in Bloomington couldn’t live in dorms or eat at any restaurant around
                        campus. George Taliaferro, an IU running back who became the first Black player drafted to the
                        NFL, helped begin integrating restaurants here when he asked then-IU President Herman B Wells
                        for help. Wells planned to get lunch with Taliaferro at the Gables restaurant, now BuffaLouie’s.
                        At first, the Gables refused, but Wells said he’d ban all students from Bloomington restaurants
                        in response. The Gables relented.

                            <p>Keith Parker was IU’s second Black student body president and a member of the Black
                                Panther party. During his time in office, he was approached by a local KKK leader who
                                was an IU truck driver, investigated by the FBI’s Counter Intelligence Program and the
                                target of frequent death threats.</p>

                                            <p><strong>KEITH PARKER: </strong>After I was elected student body
                                                president, the local Klan leader was a truck driver for the university,
                                                and he came up to me on campus and he gave me a card. And the card said,
                                                “Help integration, take a n-word home for lunch.” And he said to me,
                                                “Keith, I’m going to remember who you are, I hope you’re going to
                                                remember who I am,” and I said, “You don’t have to worry, I know who you
                                                are.” So that you know, that kind of, I think, summarizes some of my
                                                experiences during my time that I was in Bloomington.</p>
                                            <p>I had, you know, death threats. The whole time I was president. And
                                                because I was a part of the people’s peace treaty trip to North Vietnam
                                                during the war, that sort of increased the threats. You know, the
                                                letters were simple. We’re going to kill you, you’re going to die, you
                                                don’t deserve to live, you know, those kinds of threats. </p>
                                            <p>The FBI sent letters to my parents. You know, my father was a minister in
                                                Indianapolis, and they sent letters. It was part of the COINTELPRO
                                                program, counter intelligence program, that the FBI was doing against
                                                people all over the country. Well you know, because i was a member of
                                                the Black Panther party, because I was considered dangerous, you know,
                                                and because I was in a leadership place. And again, it wasn’t just me.
                                                They did that to people all over this country.</p>
                                            <p>Malcolm [X] is assassinated in February of ‘65, Black power is
                                                articulated and becomes a movement in the summer of 1966, Black Panther
                                                party is founded in October of 1966, and so you have a radicalization of
                                                young Blacks in that time, and I was one of those, and that’s what
                                                gravitated me toward the Black Panther party.</p>

                        Until the last year, there was both a street and building in Bloomington named after former IU
                        President David Starr Jordan, infamous for his belief in and support of eugenics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Nothing has changed for a person of color in America,” Mitchell said. “The same problems that
                        we had years ago, we are still addressing those problems today.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That goes back to before the Civil War, when Bloomington was a stop on the Underground Railroad.
                        But slave catchers lived on the square then too, looking for carts and wagons that might be
                        hiding slaves. Mitchell said those catchers often included IU students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Indiana is not a Southern state,” Bridgwaters said. “But it hangs right on the border.”

                                of her professional life due to a lack of opportunities for Black Bloomington residents.

                                Black female graduate of IU, were also unable to find jobs in town that met their

                                            <p><strong>VIVIAN BRIDGWATERS: </strong>We used to always say, “Bloomington
                                                is a great place to be born and it’s
                                                a great place to die.” In your youth in between, there wasn’t a lot for
                                                you in that time. The opportunities were stifled. Racism is and was
                                                real. And so if you really wanted to kind of spread your wings as a
                                                young person, most had to go elsewhere. </p>
                                            <p>My aunt, Frances Eagleson, as educated as she was, she had to really go
                                                away from here to get the type of positions that she merited based on
                                                her ability. You could go and you could apply for a job opportunity, but
                                                you weren’t going to be considered based on the color of your skin. Your
                                                color walked in the door before your sex. First thing is that you’re
                                                Black. </p>
                                            <p>There were some people in power that didn’t believe racial supremacy’s
                                                height. But on the other hand, they wanted to do business. And so you
                                                were not going to risk doing business by opening up doors that were not
                                                open. There’s pressure. </p>
                                            <p>There were some people in power that didn’t believe racial supremacists

                                            <p>I had a man that I worked for and he had me sitting in his office one day
                                                and we were talking. I was debating something with him, and he looked at
                                                me and he said, “You know, I think maybe you think a little too much of
                                                yourself. Maybe you don’t know your place.” These things are real. </p>

                        Bridgwaters said when she was in high school in the 1960s, she remembers it took a strong
                        uprising from Bloomington’s Black community to convince the town’s mayor to prevent a KKK march
                        planned to take place in town.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1922, white IU students affiliated with the KKK kidnapped Halson V. Eagleson Jr., attempting
                        to prevent him from becoming the first Black person to earn an “I” letter for the marching band.
                        Eagleson was found and the capturers were tried by an all-white jury, but never charged.
                        Eagleson would later receive the “I.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bridgwaters was still in high school in 1968. On Dec. 26 of that year, two local men with ties
                        to the KKK firebombed the Black Market, a shop located in what is now People’s Park. Bridgwaters
                        went to the Market often. There were clothes, jewelry, soaps, oils and books that represented
                        Black culture, Bridgwaters said.

                        “It was just another punch in the gut,” Bridgwaters said of the bombing. “You feel like some

                        only to find that there is racism that was still so deep that they couldn't even allow that one
                        little market, that one little place, where we could gather and buy things that expressed our
                        heritage in terms of the African piece of it, that that had to be destroyed. Even that couldn't
                        survive.”

                                            <p><strong>VIVIAN BRIDGWATERS:</strong> It was just another punch in the
                                                gut. You know,
                                                you feel like some acknowledgement of your culture and how you view the
                                                world is being accepted in your hometown, only to find that there is
                                                racism that was still so deep that they couldn’t even allow that one
                                                little market, you know, that one little place where we could gather and
                                                buy things that expressed our heritage in terms of the African piece of
                                                it, that that had to be destroyed, even that couldn’t survive. </p>
                                            <p><strong>KEITH PARKER:</strong> Everyone was angry. I don’t think people
                                                were
                                                afraid as much as they were angry. They wanted it solved, and they
                                                wanted somebody prosecuted. And that was like the violence that Black
                                                people experienced all through the South. </p>
                                            <p><strong>BRIDGWATERS:</strong> There’s anger, and it’s mixed with fear
                                                over, ‘So now what? What’s next? They’ve blown up the Black Market,
                                                what’s next?’</p>
                                            <p><strong>PARKER:</strong> You thought about the bombing of the Black
                                                Market
                                                in a larger context, that that was the Black experience in unfortunately
                                                too many other communities, and you couldn’t, you couldn’t stop because
                                                of that. You had to go on.</p>

                        When Mitchell first moved to Bloomington in 1979, she went back home to Indianapolis every
                        weekend because she felt so uncomfortable living here as a Black woman. In 1983, Bloomington
                        police officers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/us/police-killing-of-student-stuns-indiana-residents.html" target="_blank">killed Denver Smith</a>, a Black IU student and football player, by shooting him
                        four times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mitchell’s husband worked with the state police and was stationed in Bloomington. Mitchell
                        worked there too, and she remembers being called the N-word every night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mitchell is a researcher now, focusing on finding and telling Black stories in Bloomington and
                        Indiana. She participates in plays with <a href="https://resilienceproductions.org/" target="_blank">Resilience Productions</a>, a local theater group she
                        co-founded, showcasing unknown or un-celebrated Black contributions in Indiana. That interest
                        came after she said a white man who worked with her at the police told her Black people hadn’t
                        done anything for America. She wanted to prove him wrong.

                    <p>
                        And she has seen racism still prevalent in Bloomington.

                                            <p><strong>ELIZABETH MITCHELL: </strong>And the first few days that I
                                                attended Arlington High School, helped to
                                                integrate it — it was 76, 76 kids — parents showed up right before the
                                                bell was to ring for us to get out with clubs, baseball bats, and other
                                                things. I was sitting in English class and I can see them coming. Now,
                                                none of the Black adults were there. Children were there. So what are
                                                these adults going to do? Beat up on a bunch of kids? We didn’t make the
                                                laws. Nobody took the time out to ask how we felt. We knew we weren’t
                                                wanted in that school. </p>
                                            <p>One of my graduation gifts from high school was the gift of a job. I
                                                graduated on Saturday, and my dad said, “Monday you start at the police
                                                department as a clerk typist.” </p>
                                            <p>So, here I am at the police department. And an elderly white guy called
                                                me a n****, and I spoke up and I said, “What is wrong with you, I have a
                                                name,” and I told him my name, and I said, “There is just no call for,
                                                why would you do that? And why are you being a racist?” </p>
                                            <p>And he said, “Your people have done nothing to make this country great,
                                                and you are living off of what we as whites have created.” I didn’t have
                                                an answer, because I didn’t know. That was the day I decided I was going
                                                to learn what African Americans have contributed to America.</p>
                                            <p>I never felt hatred in this country until I was around white people. And
                                                my parents didn’t prepare us for that. We weren’t prepared to deal with
                                                that. But, the racism that I experienced in high school did prepare me
                                                for the racism I experienced out in the work force. And then that first
                                                job. And that first job got me ready for the next job. And if it had not
                                                been for that, I would not have been able to experience the racism on my
                                                job here in Bloomington being the first and only Black female for 35
                                                years. </p>
                                            <p>I hired in the post office Oct. 31, 1978, in Indianapolis, and
                                                transferred down here after I got married in October of ‘79. I hated
                                                Bloomington. I went home every weekend. I drove back to Indianapolis, I
                                                couldn’t stand Bloomington. </p>
                                            <p>I was called the n-word every night at work, “Why are you here, your
                                                husband’s a state trooper.” My supervisor, my first day I was greeted
                                                with, “Why is this Black heifer in here? What is she doing in here?”
                                                That was my very first day. </p>
                                            <p>I worked with, they were white veterans. They didn’t want women in there.
                                                There were very few women in there, and they just damn sure didn’t want
                                                a Black woman in there. Only one guy, no, two white men stood up for me.
                                                One was acting supervisor one night when I said, “You know I had enough,
                                                I’m going to bash some heads in.” And another guy said, “Whenever you’re
                                                ready to file a complaint legally, I will be a witness.” My husband told
                                                me to document everything, which I did, and then I went over their head
                                                after a while and reported what was happening to me to Indianapolis.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>They didn’t mess with me, a guy came down here from Indianapolis and they
                                                had to back off. People were going to get fired. </p>

                        In 2019, Bloomington community members found KKK flyers around town. Around the same time, it
                        was discovered a vendor at the Bloomington Farmer’s Market had strong white supremacist ties. On
                        July 4, 2020, former Bloomington resident <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2020/07/vauhxx-booker-attacked-by-men-yelling-racist-slurs-lake-monroe" target="_blank">Vauhxx Booker</a> was pinned to a tree near Lake Monroe by
                        two white men. The men can be heard saying they would “get a noose” in a video of the
                        altercation. The attack garnered national headlines at the peak of Black Lives Matter protests
                        and made Booker a prominent voice in the area.

                        Mitchell said Bloomington still is not always an inclusive and accepting town of minorities.
                        That’s why it made her angry to learn about all the unmarked graves in Monroe County, especially
                        for a family like the Eaglesons.

                        “The history book is America’s photo album,” Mitchell said. “How would you feel if you weren’t
                        in your family’s photo album?”

                                            <p><strong>GUY LOFTMAN: </strong>My name is Guy Loftman. I came to Indiana
                                                University as a freshman in 1963. I helped organize the first
                                                anti-Vietnam war demonstration on campus in the spring of 1965, and then
                                                in the spring of 1967 I was elected student body president. </p>
                                            <p>Well, I’m going to tell you this story, and the story includes the
                                                n-word, quoting other people that used the n-word. </p>
                                            <p>I was in a fraternity. A very bad match. Everything about it was so
                                                wrong. And George Wallace was running for president, and he came to the
                                                IU campus. And in protest, a lot of people — well, some people — wore a
                                                black and white equals sign, a white equals sign and a black background.
                                                And I wore one to dinner, and people weren't impressed, and I went back
                                                the next night and wore it and they started dinner with three chants.
                                                One was, “Wallace for president, Wallace for president, Wallace for
                                                president,” this is the whole fraternity at dinner. And then, “Kill the
                                                n*****s, kill the n*****s.” And then, “Fuck Loftman, fuck Loftman, fuck
                                                Loftman.” And I decided I just wouldn’t have anything to do with those
                                                gentlemen any longer, and quit the fraternity. But it was really
                                                radicalizing. I had no idea there was so much hatred among people who
                                                had insisted we were all brothers. </p>
                                            <p>The fraternities all had bylaws that prohibited any Jews and Blacks from
                                                becoming members. And, you know, it wasn’t even anything anybody would
                                                ask whether you had to be Christian, you know, but I bet it was there.
                                                It’s not like a lot of Muslims were going through rush. </p>
                                            <p>The student body president at that time, or the year, right in there, the
                                                student body president was Black. Tom Atkins was his name. And I’m sure
                                                they didn’t like that. Race, integration, Civil Rights was happening,
                                                and integration was happening, and these guys did not like it.</p>

                        The living who love this place have more friends among the dead than those still alive with
                        them. At least that’s what Tony Mitchell says.

                        Tony often eats lunch at Rose Hill, and typically, he’s not sure if he’s eating alone. He
                        unwraps his Hinkle’s cheeseburger and crinkle fries to have a conversation with a stone. J.B.
                        Crafton’s stone, that is. He sits next to J.B., or maybe it’s better to say he’s sitting on him.
                        J.B.’s body isn’t there; he died on the Titanic. His body is somewhere at the bottom of the
                        Atlantic Ocean.

                        “J.B. let’s eat, you don’t mind do you?” Tony says.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He chomps on his burger and sips his Diet Coke, his walking stick leaning against J.B.’s grave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “How’d that ticket work out for ya,” he jokes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tony’s best friends are dead. But he didn’t know most of them when they were alive anyway,
                        despite his family tracing Bloomington roots back to the 1820s. He’s come to meet them all
                        through years of strolling through the cemetery on days off. He works with Boy Scouts, too, and
                        is fascinated by Bloomington and its history. Ask him any Bloomington trivia question: What
                        statue is atop the Monroe County courthouse? Tony knows — it’s a fish, by the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One final sip on his Diet Coke and Tony stands up to begin the tour. He gets up and turns to the
                        east, checking his compass as he walks along the headstones. Tony stops at 39 degrees north, -86
                        degrees west, and looks down at Andrew Ferguson. His stone is flat along the ground.
                    </p>

                        Ferguson was one of roughly 5,000 Black soldiers in the Continental army. He was wounded in the
                        head by General Charles Cornwallis’ troops near Guilford, North Carolina. Ferguson spent months
                        recovering in Virginia, where he was born, before spending the last few decades of his life in
                        Bloomington.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He didn’t get a headstone until around 150 years after his death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No one really knows why. There is not much documented history on Ferguson other than census
                        records, according to a <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24304172/andrew-ferguson" target="_blank">Herald-Times report</a> in 2008.

                        Tony turns around and leads the way back to the Ford, passing the Eagleson plot on the way. He’s
                        shown the cemeteries’ oldest portions, but he finishes the tour on four wheels. He drives onto
                        the pavement and hums “Say, Has Anybody Seen my Sweet Gypsy Rose” by Tony Orlando & Dawn. The
                        truck winds through the cemetery and stops on a curve next to a gravestone.

                    <p>
                        The face of George Shively, printed on his headstone, stares back at him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shively was one of the greatest Negro League baseball players of all time and in the Hall of
                        Fame. For decades, he didn’t have a headstone either. Negro League players did not make the same
                        salaries as their white counterparts playing Major League Baseball and despite far outperforming
                        scores of white athletes, Shively and his family weren’t able to afford a headstone.

                        More than 50 years after Shively’s death in 1962, a page in the History Center’s yearly calendar
                        planned to feature Shively’s athletic achievements. But before it printed, Emery went around
                        Bloomington’s cemeteries looking for headstones of the athletes mentioned in the calendar, and
                        there was no trace of Shively. The calendar ultimately stated that Shively did not have a stone,
                        prompting Bloomington residents to fundraise to purchase a proper memorial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Money came in quickly, and by April 2015, there was a ceremony to unveil the headstone attended
                        by over 100 people at Plot C23, no more than 75 yards from H.V.’s unmarked grave. At the
                        ceremony, the attendees held hands and sang “We Shall Overcome.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tony kept driving, slowly, windows rolled down so he could point to the different sites. He
                        stopped at Hoagy Carmichael’s gravesite and even briefly pointed out his own family members
                        buried in Rose Hill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tour was over then. He drove back to the main gates and waved goodbye to his friends.

                        Bridgwaters didn’t know the city was changing the street name. She was at home when her sister
                        Betty called her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Did you know…” Bridgwaters recalls hearing on the phone
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Have you seen…”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She didn’t know. She hadn’t seen.

                    <p>
                        But her family told her to check the newspaper, so she got a copy of the Herald-Times. When
                        Bridgwaters opened the newspaper on Sept. 15, she saw her great-grandfather’s name below the
                        headline: <a href="https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/local/2021/09/15/bloomington-indiana-jordan-avenue-eagleson-avenue-ok-renaming-after-prominent-black-family/8336481002/" target="_blank">“Bloomington approves renaming Jordan Avenue after prominent Black family.”</a>

                    <p>
                        Many names on the headstones at Rose Hill can be found on Bloomington’s street signs. And soon,
                        Eagleson will be one of those too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s not a headstone — not yet at least. But it’s recognition. It’s recognition replacing a name
                        directly tied to racism in Bloomington. “Eagleson” will be a marker in Bloomington.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is now Jordan Avenue between East Davis Street to East 17th Street will become Eagleson
                        Avenue this February. That stretches directly through IU’s campus, including right past the
                        Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center and Wells Library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In December, IU <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2021/12/jordan-avenue-rename-eagleson-avenue-iu-board-of-trustees-approve" target="_blank">officially approved</a> the renaming of the city-owned section of what was Jordan
                        Avenue to Eagleson Avenue, as initially proposed and approved by the Bloomington City Council
                        this fall.

                                            <p>I don’t know, I don’t think white children were as aware as
                                                we were of the segregation and so forth. In Greensburg,
                                                there weren’t many Black people, there was no segregation.
                                                We went to the Black church, they went to the white church,
                                                but we didn’t have any interest in going to their church. We
                                                were integrated when we went to high school. And we never
                                                became really integrated. They had their social life and
                                                their interests, and we had ours. </p>
                                            <p>I remember the first day I went to this lovely school, they
                                                were playing London Bridge is falling down. And I saw the
                                                teachers, they were talking, and I knew I was the problem.
                                                So finally, they talked to a little boy, and he came over
                                                and asked me to be his partner. And I told him no. So you
                                                see how early we learned prejudice. I didn't dislike him,
                                                but he was a white boy. And I wasn’t going to dance with a
                                                white boy. </p>
                                            <p>I knew Aunt Sadie didn’t associated with any white people in
                                                that neighborhood. We would go and visit Black people, and
                                                we’d go blocks to visit them, but never anybody next door,
                                                because they were all white. And if they were ill, we didn’t
                                                go see them. If a Black person was ill, we went to see them
                                                to see what we could do, how we could help them. And we knew
                                                we would be welcome. But you see, one thing that kept you
                                                from being like that, was you weren’t sure that you would be
                                                welcome. </p>
                                            <p>I remember on one occasion, my grandfather had a barbershop
                                                on College Avenue, and a man whose hair he had cut, this man
                                                was one of the white customers — you see, white people let
                                                you do anything for them if you’ve got the right position.
                                                But when he came out he slipped and fell and one of the
                                                black barbers went out to help him up, and he said to him,
                                                “Don’t touch me. I don’t want a n***** to touch me.” Unless
                                                you knew the people, you didn’t offer to do anything for
                                                them, because you didn’t know what their reaction would be
                                                and so why would you bother? </p>
                                            <p>All of us have been exposed to or have some racism in us. I
                                                taught it to my children as a defense mechanism. I didn’t
                                                consider it racism. I considered it a defense mechanism,
                                                because you send these trusting little children out into a
                                                world of prejudice, and they come home hurt and sometimes
                                                destroyed because they didn’t expect it, they don’t know
                                                what to do with it, they don’t know how to beat it. </p>
                                            <p>And it has been, it took me a long time to realize that white
                                                people are just people. They’re not the devil incarnate.
                                                Some of them are lovely people. And some of them are the
                                                devil incarnate. But the same is true of Black people. But I
                                                excused Black people because they were my people and that
                                                was different, as white people excuse their people, and when
                                                they want to talk about the no-goods, they don’t talk about
                                                white people, they talk about Black people. </p>

                        Bridgwaters was thrilled when the story published, beaming as she recalled her memories of that
                        day. She smiled sitting in her chair reading the paper and turned to look at a photo of H.V.
                        resting on the mantle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She looked at the photo of him, and she proudly gave him a thumbs up as if to announce, “We did
                        it.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The thumbs up acknowledged that finally, 100 years later, there would be dignity in the memory
                        of his life for the entire Bloomington community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There will be a ceremony in February 2022 when the new street sign is unveiled. Bridgwaters said
                        she plans to be there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eagleson will finally be afforded remembrance beyond his church window. On a headstone and a
                        street sign, he will join the famous names at the foundation of this town’s landmarks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project has not made much progress yet, Scott Emery said in November. Fundraising efforts
                        are being established, but most of the decision-making comes from discussions with the Eagleson
                        and Bridgwaters families. Many decisions — such as what type of headstone they’d like — have yet
                        to be made. Recent health emergencies in the Bridgwaters family have taken precedence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As such, no timeline exists for when the stone might be unveiled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bridgwaters lives across the street from Rose Hill now. It being too much for her to walk,
                        Bridgwaters drives over to visit her family every few months these days — whenever it feels
                        right, she said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="line-after">
                        Soon, she’ll have one more headstone to bring flowers for. And she’ll know exactly when she’s
                        talking to her great-grandfather.
